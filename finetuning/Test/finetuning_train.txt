Another violent and aggressive immigrant killing a innocent and intelligent US Citizen.... SarcasmI am 56 years old, I am not your fucking junior pal. What you are saying makes no sense. I don't know what you are basing this on. The cheap black market crap is still coming up from Mexican nationals, and the good stuff from BC and Humbolt.  The I5 corridor is still just as busy, and they are still making a ton of money. Nothing has really changed except that the legal market has made it easy for anyone of legal age to buy it.  And the legal market is controlled by corporate growers with million dollar facilities, or a co-op of smaller growers. The Federal government "war on drugs" really has no impact on the legal market in Oregon. I don't see any glutton of weed, whatever that means.Damn, a whole family. Sad indeed.What a knucklehead. How can anyone not know this would be offensive??"who do you think should do the killing?"

Anyone and everyone. This is a community problem, so everyone who wants to be part of the solution should be allowed to help. As I said above: remove all protections on free ranging cats, and allow people to help. People who allow their pets to roam outside are part of the problem, because their pets are part of the problem. It would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.

Years ago some Vermont acquaintances got one warning from the Ranger: Next time I see your dog running deer, I'll shoot it. Next time she saw it running deer, she did. 

Vermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves. If we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. Neutered cats eat birds. Don't release them. Kill them.But, but, but, is NOT a defense.  It's not even a good deflection.  In America today we have Nazis waving the Nazi flag at rallies in our cities. In what capacity does anyone think this is ok and who would not see that as a problem?

Enough with the "Well what about blah blah" garbage.Please people, stop using these silly, stupid emoticons.Dumb.Obamacare is on it's last gasping breaths.   You idiots who don't want something else passed that's going to save your free healthcare are kind of stupid.   But if you block anything else that gives you socialized healthcare it's your own fault for being unbudging.  You can go back to nothing when nothing further is passed and Obamacare is just an ugly memory.CROOKED Trump = GUILTY as hell.
patheticYou conveniently don't mention your cohorts who call for extermination of Jews and Blacks. With guys like IQ006, IQ22, and the rest in your corner, well, I wouldn't call you  loathsome or deplorable like them but I think " imbecile" has some merit for your selectivity.Brilliant retort... It only makes sense that in order to weigh in on government and its decisions, you need to be also running for office during a non-existent election. Oh wait, only an idiot would think that.Too bad.  Jeff Sessions has no common sense and is nearly as mean and morally repugnant as his boss, Trump.This man is a sickening, mentally ill joke.Religion is a crutch for the ignorant masses of humanity. Indoctrination centers and molestatoriums are what they are. Jerry is most likely a closet cross dressing homosexual. Me think he doth protest to much....lolNo, I'm saying, based on previous comments you've made at NCR, that you're a Nazi apologist. Don't bother responding to my comments. My reply will always be a big "f*** you.""In doing so, they cite oil industry assurances that..."  

The only way they could be stupid enough to believe those assurances is if they're paid to believe them.What a sociopathic and parasitic leader we have.We would all be better off if the President was sane.  He's not, of course.   His sad sycophants think he's being tough, when in fact, Trump is being an imbecile.  LeBron James is right.  Trump is a bum.Trump is so dumb!
HAHAHAHAHAHA!Kill some more kids and then complain about guns, LOL the left is a jokeJim

I think Donald is a con man and a dangerous, narcissistic buffoon. But I don't hate Donald.  He's not worth the emotional effort needed to hate. To say I hate him is to admit that I even care about him, which I don't. What I do care about is the damage he's already caused to this country, and the continuing damage he'll cause to this country and the world until he leaves office.There's plenty of wrong-wingers out there that empathize with the refugee issues.  Don't be such a fool.Excellent point!  What if a mob assembled outside his offices and used violence to stop editors from publishing the magazines?  That's the point and how a guy like him could miss it is either purposeful or incredibly ignorant of the issue at hand.Exposing hypocrites like Trump and Pence is therapeutic for you? Good job!Damn - I thought you had to be able to read to be a Coast Guard officer!  Guess I was wrong.  I guess the eagle didn't like the smell of San Francisco - grin.Trump made fun of a disabled reporter and half of the people still supported him. Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women and half the people still supported him. Trump's health care cuts are going to effect a large number of his supporters. How's that workin' out for ya? I wonder how many Trump supporters have children with special needs and can't afford a private school. Trump and his new swamp full of sociopaths don't scare me. What scares me is living in a country where half the population still supports them. Ron White was right when he said,"You can't fix stupid."The malignant narcissist, mentally deranged sociopath, bigot, rascist, disingenuous blowhard and pathological liar, has now certified himself as a fascist. How much longer before his GOP sycophants and suckees say, "Enough!", and demand this repugnant, excrement-spewing fool's ouster?They elected Trump, which was certainly a mistake.
Judges, however, rarely make stupid mistakes.The trump foundation is a money laundering scam. The orange one is trying to kill it before the long arm of the law opens the door to the Augean stables.and yet another ignorant propaganda believing alt left sheep,, no loser trump is making great progress regardless of the lunatic opposition fromtthe dems.. .. no one is saying  attack iran but as usual you lunatics make up anything for fake news accusations. .the world needs to ignore brainless sheep like youother religions aren't carrying out the violent and extremist doctrines as Islamists are.Ah, the rants of a paranoid, ignorant misogynist.Actually, I discovered that there is a company that makes a crotch holster for these tiny guns,   It allows the person to carry it inside the front of their pants, next to their testicles.

It is really quite stupid and perverted.   Take a look at this photo of it:

.I hope he and other car theves  read this, I'll shoot you if I catch you in my vehicles stealing then call the police.
Don't worry you won't be going to prison I'll put you in GRAVE YARD!!!!!!!!!!!

No one should have to put up with these NO HOPERS THAT BREAK INTO VEHICLES.
THANKS TO THE TRASH ON OUR STREETS I NOW CARRY A 40 cal and won't hesitate to use it.Oh, I don't know.  Kind of worked for George W......well, at least the moron part.Why even bother to give this woman a time of day. Bury her in the cotton field where she belong..
"tornado selfies" Equals
"Social Media" Morons.
.Canada treats inmates with true savagery.  We have no claim to call this a civilized country while brutal scum hold sway in our institutions.And there are many of us who are appalled at the idea and are even more ready to oppose it after watching Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump in action. They are incompetent bunglers who live off a rhetoric of hate.Those who see criminal antifa members as "authorities" needed to put white supremacists "in their place" don't seem to understand that the antifa criminals give the white supremacists "their place" in the pages of the MSM.

The legitimate "authorities," acting with the power of the state, have typically made very sane and rational decisions to allow white supremacists to exercise their right to free speech alone, in dark corners where no one notices them.  But for antifa idiots, that sad process would have gone on quietly until it died a lonely natural death.She said: "To President Martindale, to Sen. Sessions, Mayor Bright, Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, Ms. Johnnie Carr, Juanita Abernathy, Mammie Till-Mobley, to all of the distinguished program participants and guests in this audience today, it's a great honor and a privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum." Coretta Scott King

She's not honoring Sessions, she's being courteous to all dignitaries.

It's not beside the point, it is the point. Tell the truth instead of twisting it around to deflect away from Sessions and his background of racist bigotry.Well, but that is a most valid point for guestsquared to bring up about you.   You were all on the bandwagon to engage in a witch hunt against this man, all based on an allegation of a sole person, without any collaborating evidence of any kind.   

You would have most definitely fit in very well in Salem, Massachusetts back in 1692.   You would have been among the throngs yelling "Hang the witch".

Face it.   There was not enough evidence for an arrest to have ever been made.   

And the judge did not make any ruling on this case, as you so falsely state here.    It was the DA herself, who requested that the case be dismissed.   The judge simply granted her request.   So even the District Attorney's office believes that the charges are not believable.

So why don't you?   Answer:  You are a racist.
.You're a paid Russian troll, right?  You can't be THAT stupid.  You are using your own premise to prove yourself wrong.These kids have no idea what the he'll their protesting about.  The democrats are reaping what they sowed. All idiots. This will pass when they get bored and tired of being broke. Just like the 60sI think we need to consider the possibility that the Trump White House is populated by morons.And Faux News will still be stupid, like their viewing audience.what a hypocrite of bs,, tell us loser how you live without gasoline, plastic, medical needs and medications, all from OIL,, but you cant of course so you ignorant fools in your hypocrisy spew this bsDarn.
Another wasted program on TV..What a coward.  Take your own but leave innocent people alone.  I feel sorry for the innocent lives lost here but feel nothing for the coward loser that died.Not much, but caused a whole lot of  negative shit.Republicans have shown themselves to be idiotic by going with the town butcher to perform brain surgery.  How is that working out for you republican?  Glad those democrats don't run Government.  Hell, we might have a balanced budget by now.  lolYou idiots must all be on crack!!! Mushers do not mis treat their dogs and fewer dogs die on the Iditarod than in the homes of you idiots!!! The public dog owner does way more damage than a musher to their dogs. Running dogs don't run unless they want to and are well cared for athletes. Put that in your dumb ass pipes and blow it up your noses along with the crack!!!Really? Now we have Trump, who's crazed. Period.Democrats still can't face the fact that they have been voted out of the White House.  Russian influence?  What a load of crap!I've often wondered just how stupid stupid can get. "...and require a gender-based analysis." pretty well answers the question.I don't care who it demeans, Trump is nuts.I am totally with you on this continued stupidity that has been US policy, and now Hawaiis effort. I was a military officers wife expecting my second son, stationed in Germany at this time. As I recall, Kennedy gave Kruschev an opportunity to " save face". I doubt that Trump has the intelligence or skill, nor has he picked an intelligent UN rep. Or cabinet. This is where investigative journalism makes the difference. I am glad that Civil Beat is challenging the status quo mentality.These young women and men are just Immoral, nasty, dirty people.Said a village idiot.the is NO CONSENSUS you ignorant loser, NONE, nothing but debate, thousands of scientist do not agree period, we dont need to move from anything other than left wing stupidity like yours.It's the number of people arrested over their lifetime--its between a quarter and a third of the population, and about half of all black men.  About one in three black men in America is a felon.  Google it if you don't believe it.blast you stupid
you people! fine them. good and hard. jerks.Newt Gingrich is the has-been of the decade.  Let's all just forget this champion loser.They only catch the dumb ones.Reading what she said doesn't fully convey the mocking tone she adopted (you can hear her speech online) - it's the tone of "Can you believe there are still MORONS who don't believe in climate change but do believe in alternative medicine and hold religious beliefs!?! What idiots!"

BTW, our Prime Minister has said he is a practicing Catholic and he has dabbled in alternative medicine, such as cupping. Does that make him a moron in Payette's eyes?Who steals the most food, starving whites or filthy rich blacks?Still a scumbag.This woman, Chrystia Freeland, went on US television last year and stated that it was wrong to criticize certain segments of the Muslim population for honour killings, female genital mutilation, and persecution of gays.

She is a far-left, bat*** crazy, cultural marxist.Are you really that ignorant?You are a corrupt compulsive lying stalker, WesterPatriot and should be removed.you're the queen of idiotic comments. why not call the dispatch and demand that everybody comments be removed. oh wait,,,you already have.They are pulling the same crap on Maui and even with tons of opposition, developers are being given the ok.How do these idiots keep getting elected? Brad Sherman there is no investigation ongoing for Trump and if you knew anything about the presidency you would know he could just as easily have pardoned Flynn and closed any and all further investigations on him or anyone for that matter because he has that authority and you or others could not do any thing about it! Because he already has this authority he cannot be held for obstruction at all go back to law school!"in their, damn we been caught, outrage over Harvey Winstein"
What did the right have to say about Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, James Baker, Jimmy Swaggart, etc?Folks.     These people should seriously be dubbed    "The Goof Troop"........    Total Whack a moles..  literally a comedy of errors and idiots        Hopefully not t become a tragedyThis woman is disgusting. Make the ignorant voters think there's a positive, to ensure she returns to power. This is nothing more than vote buying. Notice that she'll be in retirement by the time the clueless, well, clue in. Oh my God. 

Fire her now. Don't vote Liberal anymore.Should have just ran his useless meth head ass over.38 million pieces of trash.....
Matches California's  population....
Coincidence?....It is not the people who are out of touch, but this clown crew. People need to stand up and kick them out as they did in the U.S.Fool.It's pretty easy Bill Hooper. When he says, and I quote direct from the Don's lips "There are many fine people on both sides". He has clearly taken the stance that marchers for White Supremacy and the KKK have fine people. That makes him a pathetic racist.aa nadda showing the usual stupidity, its clowns like you that live outside reality, see pal canada needs the usa, the usa does not need us. , dont get me wrong, trudeau an ignorant child with no leadership skills doing real damage to canada with bs like carbon taxes...Don't like a taste of your own medicine, do ya?  You big party supporters ALWAYS attack the opposition when it's in office.  The only difference is you think it's justified and when the other side does it, it isn't.  

Dems=Repubs.  Same crap, different diaper.All parish school employees serve at the pleasure of the pastor and secondary school employees are accountable through the principal to the bishop who has the last word. That needs to be something everyone who serves in those environments needs to take to heart if they have qualms about those to whom they report. Given the need for teachers and administrators anyone not comfortable with a priest micromanaging a parish school should give notice. When the diocese finds they can not find or retain quality staff they will do some introspection and correct what isn't working, unless they are self-righteous idiots.Chuck Nasty will be battling some mediocre player from the East coast for MVP.  Its ridiculous, that East Coast bias!"is he still (a) evil-incarnate; (b) a corrupt idiot and/or (c) a Russian stooge"
(a) no.
(b) yes.
(c) jury is still out. Leave Trump in a room alone with Putin, and Russia will have a warm-water port in Hawaii.nonsense.............
Congress is full of Republicans who are too useless to pass laws .........
..............especially laws that address the issue.You are obviously a fool.You're a racist troll who's copied someone else's account is what you are.Stupid! 

Get rid of prayer, period. 

Balance my balls on your nose!I wonder if Leah's husband is a cuck.Trump is a bootlicking Russian traitorThis is the stupidest excuse for a lawsuit I've ever seen. It basically means no president can ever change his mind about anything. Once he publicly says something, he's glued to that forever.

Democrats have lost their idiot minds.Jim Hanlen, if you have a choice, ask for Sharia.  They take pity on idiots.fun, fun, fun,  this is why we are fans,  good luck ducks, but not to much, go huskers!Sorry. I speak the truth and I'm just not politically correct. Trump supporters are stupid.I agree. Trump has proven to be exactly that, and more; he "regularly incites political violence, is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."There is no defending stupid...Just when I thought I had heard everything, "Throwing semen at women". EXTREMELY ODD....Gotta be a  Mental Health Illness candidate. 

ORS 163.415,  A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree if:

(a) The person subjects another person to sexual contact and:

(A) The victim does not consent to the sexual contact; or

(B) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being under 18 years of age; or

(b) For the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the person or another person, the person intentionally propels any dangerous substance at a victim without the consent of the victim.

(3) As used in this section, "dangerous substance" means blood, urine, semen or feces. 

10 years ago I knew a Lane County Deputy that went to work one day and when he went into his office he passed by his secretary, said Good Morning, and put his hand on HER shoulder as a friendly, warm gesture. She filed sexual abuse, she won, he was fired.  What about a hand shake?My neighborhood had a gay, straight, tranny, granny, psycho, non-psycho, maybe=psycho, could be psycho
march for under noticed imbeciles.....

everyone showed upMatt lands the knockout punch. Please Donk, don't get up you are entirely in the wrong ring and look a fool.There is overwhelming video evidence as well as web pages, manifestos, college Campus recruiting posters, etc for ANTIFA, BLM, etc. Not to mention your uncle Soros and his efforts. You know that silly.Sometimes I am SO embarrassed to say I'm Alaskan. The intelligence level of a great many if stupifying! 'They're gonna take our guns away!' SO moronic!my god , YES get over it, he is just letting wynne bury herself idiotCanada's optimism was crushed by the unpleasant surprise that Trudeau is a liar and a coward.I think the term is anal expulsive.Typical low IQ trumphobic letter.ScottG laughs rather than face the truth.  He evidently averts his eyes from "children raising children," from children raised to believe they are slaves to the sexual urges, from the fact that poor children are often the product of their parents' inability to see beyond the moment.  Fool.As opposed to the "dumb meter"?Roy Moore is one of those cons that really seems to struggle with understanding this country and its laws. It seems like he struggles with a great many things, actually. He is a creationist, for example. He also didn't seem to understand the law when it came to gay marriage.


So...of course the cons voted for this idiot.Qualifies as an imbecilic non sequiturSo you just use someone else's trash then, and let someone else pay for disposing of it? Just another free loader? Thief?
So special you are...I wonder what these idiots will do today, i.e. sit, stretch or just scratch their asses during the anthem!President Trump did not "overestimate the number of people.....", America First is killing the knee jerks. These "protesters and  fellow travelers" just grandstand and try to make the opposition look like a popular movement, when it is actually carefully orchestrated and most of these useful idiots are just being played like a fiddle. This bunch is a small number of malcontents trying to look as if they represent the majority. Trouble is most Americans aren't buying this fake outrage.You mean Joshua Witt, who described the attack for Facebook but has not filed a polics report? Most news agencies report crimes filed by police departments, if he didn't report a crime, no one's really going to listen and the local news will generally overlook it. If he filed a report, it would be found under the Crime section of the News first. Nothing about a stabbing in Sheridan currently listed, but that could change. A cut that requires 3 stitches isn't really a knifing, that's closer to "attacked by a drunk idiot" headline.What grown-ups? Trump has filled his administration with incompetent morons. And the same goes for the GOP.It doesn't matter who wins. With a choice between a loudmouthed obnoxious buffoon or a lying cheating thief, Americans are screwed regardless.You know all about stupidity with your computer jibe.We are indeed governed by an Idiot, but a hug and selfie will make it all better.Those who inject illegal and dangerous drugs into their bodies are idiots and losers of the lowest kind.  If I had my way, there would be a lot more jails built.  Those maggots are responsible for the decline of society.  Who cares if they kill themselves with dirty needles.  Where do they get the drugs, and why are the pushers running around free?  What kind of a clown show do you have for police, anyway?yeah cholo already took a trip. right over the damn dog.Why do the illogical ignorant idiots always use nicknames that suggest they are the complete opposite?  Fella, go with "loony4Assad"...it suits you.Shes not smart enough to be a professor. Just another out of state activist paid to post idiotic left wing bombsCalling Sarah Palin a blithering idiot is a simple statement of fact. Did you ever listen to that word salad in which she demonstrated that she is not a quitter by, well, quitting? 

My point is that people who consider Palin, Coulter and Bachmann serious political voices are not showing great intelligence in choosing who is to speak for them.

"Your arrogance notwithstanding" is not exactly a model of civility, is it?I suppose the Russians were punished for Stalin's misdeeds? Gosh you are a stupid Dork!And yet the MSM still rants on about how stupid Trump is..."It would be like the United States naming a new aircraft carrier the "Richard M. Nixon" the 37th US President who resigned under a cloud as he was on the cusp of being impeached."
.............. 
Please don't give Republicans and Trump any more stupid ideasBy her own logic one might surmise she's either here temporarily for the sole purpose of defending native Canadian rights and nothing else or she should dispose of everything she owns and leave the country so it can be reacquired by natives. Since neither is likely true she's just a common hypocrite with a racist streak.you're one sick puppy.Trump is an animal.Great article, Shoaltsie!

People like Auston Matthews make decent Americans look like idiots. He should stick to what he knows--hockey!Stupid question.  This is still a new administration.Can we have a class action suit against the Russian Candidate for market losses due to his stupidity and big mouth.

Oh, I forgot. Stupidity is not an offense and a big mouth not a crime when you are Prezzy.

Caveat Emptor.Try reading my entire comment again, except slower, and then take a few moments for reflection, days if need be. If by then you still don't understand that the Trumpster is Putins bitch, you'll never get it.Exactly, due to the fact the vast majority of the whites in the Rust Belt in Florida are as dumb as a post these fake Hillary news stories caused them to vote for Trump. There is no Reason Hillary should have lost to this buffoon, Russia's fake news and the stupidity of your average white American are why we now have the Trumpster in office.why we can't kill these perps is beyond me. one bullet, problem solved.What on earth would you want me to say that I have not said already ? Does this prove anything? I have a suggestion for you, if people had not been drunk, stoned and/or on drugs this situation would have never happened.  This simply proves my point - Intoxicated people cause trouble and do VERY stupid things.Not really seeing what your cynical, self stroking comment has to do with some jerk that had to skirt the system that is trying to keep out these invasive species and drive his trailer/boat into Green Mtn without going through the proper channels.  But, not matter how right you think you are and how terrible of a place this is for you, nobody is keeping you here.  Just go back on the same road that brought you here, make CO a better place and beat it!

"....attending school without shooting their classmates.."  what an ass you are!This government does not have any business acumen - there has to be creative ways to be more business friendly - we have elected a imbecile.Your "no" is mistaken on both counts. The real reason for not ordaining women is sexism, and your support of this sexism is made clear in your statements.

The one who doesn't know what the facts are is you, not me. But you are happy in your ignorance.DAMN Grover! Preach it son.Still waiting for your "complete knowledge".  That's the problem with FUD, you can't back up your own BS with any sources.  My guess is that you're a Lockheed shill and you think that your FUD will influence Canadians.  The problem is that the average Canadian, unlike the average American has an education that's worth a damn and we know what goes on around the world.  Your useless rhetoric won't sway anyone north of the border."There is no cure for stuck on stupid." That is the general thought about Trump and his lickspittles.This is a pet peeve of mine. I'm not sure that "iconic" qualifies as an idiom, but the lazy, mindless use of this word by journalists and announcers has robbed it of almost all meaning. Offenders, stop saying "iconic", you're being moronic.How fucking stupid are you?Actually it does as according to Wikipedia Mexcians and blacks (both darker skin) are twice (and more than three times in the black community) to commit and be incarcerated for crimes, you can view it here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States

He was simply offering a description of the person, the same way the Police would when describing a person - "Dark skinned, hispanic, burning garbage illegally"....

Perhaps you are the racist.Earl:  If a Black person were to fly the Confederate flag, the bold symbol of racism, I would "qualify" it as stupidity.  Why don't you go out and find a Black person flying it, give me a call, and we'll both go ask him or her.  I'll sit by the phone.  Thanks for the question.   Gary CrumTrump just has another month before his Supreme Court pick is in place.  Chin is just peeing into the wind. This is nothing but mental masturbation."Who gets to decide whether there's a benefit? You or the patrons?"

What a cheap shot. Globe needs to shut this system down if this is going to become nothing but a platform for personal abuse.

This type of mean spirited rhetoric is simply redundant 'trash-talk'.

.Saying idiotic things is a right. That doesn't make them less idiotic.Only a fectless bitch-boy would cave to such excrement...It is fake news only if it's negative to Trump's image and behavior.  He just wants specific people to be named as sources so that it will have a chilling effect on people coming forward to share information with the media.  It's not illegal to have anonymous sources.  Trump just wants to silence people.  Quite similar to North Korea and Russia.  The Petulant President is a Boorish Bully.Your one sick ass, could imagine you laughing when such happens to your loved ones!Yup. NVN used the Press. The Press was USED. Used like their sister on prom night!
Idiots. All faux-erudite, not realizing they were being played.Wow.  You are living in the past.  Just keep on believing in your hero, good luck with that.  Trump has power, not intelligence, and he doesn't even have as much power as he believes.  'Stupid is as stupid does.' -Forest GumpBecause our government is screwed upI'm all for progress but not at the expense of bankrupting the county.   That's your nonsense definition of progress  which is why we are in this mess to begin with.  The fact you even defend the indefensible shows the idiotic thinking you posses.These idiotic studies are upsetting. Where is the information that is surprising. Any person in any walk of like could and would state these (study) results?[To say that juxtaposing and making the same a massacre and overtly implying that someone had something to do with that massacre is mere "negligence" is absolutely asinine]
You confer what is determined based upon the evidence is "extremely silly or stupid?"  Is that how you see federal courts and judges function?
[Those "journalists" knew one thing had nothing to do with the other]
What are you waiting for?  You better call Palin and tell her you have evidence that proves the "journalists" knew that the two were not connected because that'll prove there was actual malice.
Wait.  Why don't I hear you dialing?
[Your unrelated SCOTUS case is cute]
Let me get this straight.  The judge in this article used exactly the standard but you deem it as "unrelated?"
You sir, are in complete and completely irrational denial.  It is clear that no construction of words and facts will make a lick of difference to you as you delude yourself into believing you know the law better than anyone else.You mean you'd stand idly by and let tRump grab you between the legs, Davis?  You don't think that couldn't happen to you?  Fool.So you would rather be governed by a lying idiot, who is selling us out to the Yankees?god woman, take a break. you sound like a retard with your never ending stupid trump comments. get help...fastThis is just another wild attempt by the Ontario Liberals to grab at any money they can, in a desperate attempt to mask how badly they have mismanaged Ontario's finances and resources. In any other country they would be thrown from office and likely put on trial. Here, we re-elect them.

The Wynne government are ignorant, greedy thieves, and Ontario deserves them.Mr. Trump is an imbecile.  He's an embarrassment to the United States.

Thankfully, his popularity drops every single day.  He's increasingly irrelevant , although his sycophant supporters haven't figured that out yet.Liberals are just useful idiots and aren't even fun to play with.   The serious apparatchiks are a bit of a challenge and there is some sport in that.For the purposes of testing, here's my contribution:

lol wut wat a bunch of bullshit

the author is a delusional stupid jerk full of crap

(I just can't bring myself to use stronger profanity and personal attacks.)credits still cost us net in real dollars you liberal sack of stupidEligible Americans appear to enjoy Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, Unemployment Benefits, Workers' Comp., Corbel; and so will you when and if you live long enough to enjoy the first three federal bennies.  Stop being a hypocrite.Moilee, another alias for Trump, Bannon, Pence, Kellyanne Conway, with the same false lying narrative, deflecting the blame on Democrats and everyone else opposed to this CROOKED LYING PRESIDENCYHey Ryoko here is a master dick for you to suck."If everyone would just ignore the morons, they'd likely dissolve into no message at all."

Do you feel the same way about the NFL kneelers?O shit my computer was hacked by the socialist power brokers. i am not a crock!!!!!Does anyone remember the Stuxnet virus. The one which made those Iranian centrifuges spin out of control? Israel and the US were falling over themselves to claim credit for it. While this action was regarded a good thing it none the less was a major cyber war attack on a foreign country. So now the shoe is on the other foot and it is certainly not appreciated.  I fear that one day these drone assassinations will come back to haunt us the same way.  We should always think long and hard before we open up a new can of worms since those chickens might come home to roost.
As far as this particular incident is concerned had the Clinton team not made these dis paring and despicable remarks about Bernie Sander and the Catholics they would not needed to fear the exposure of the e-mails.
How stupid can you get.About the same percentage as Trumplodites in America?you just proved old folk can be naive and stupid.it is time for ignorant sheep like you to get some mental help,, the NRA is a group that stands for freedom ,, they have prevented crime and stood for freedom.. you are a nut job of stupidityEvery damn Fall we get these winds that blow the leaves off of our trees, so we lose some of the enjoyment of a colorful scene.  Then again, it's better hunting...This vile trash lives and breathes on lies, while calling the media dishonest and fake.

For example, Cheeto Hitler has repeatedly described his victory over Hillary Clinton as a “historic” and “massive” landslide. That’s not the case. His Electoral College victory actually ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections. He lost the popular vote to Clinton by about 2.8 million votes.  That's hardly “historic” and the furthest thing from “massive.” This is a flat-out lie, even if you allow a little embellishment for the sake of a good story.

Two questions for ADN readers: 1) Is anyone else concerned that this spitting, gesticulating, tantrum-throwing toddler has the nuclear codes? 2) How long before the idiots that voted for him realize and admit their mistake?Fact #1 In 2016 the NFL ratings were the lowest in decades, costing the team owners many millions of dollars.

Fact #2 A Rasmussen poll found 32% of adults are less likely to watch games due the Kaepernick-led player protests.

Fact #1 plus Fact #2 equals fire the idiots who bite the hands that made them millionaires.Are democrat politicians and bureaucrats the sickest group of people you've ever seen, or what?Would you have preferred he start the letter- Dear Mr. President, You are an ignorant, evil, hateful person, and need to be impeached.This is ridiculous.CNN, WAPO, and NYT are reporting that an unnamed source's sisters who was told by a janitors third cousin who got it from a guy who knew a security guard's step brother says that Trump will be impeached. :):)  You are just simple "useful idiot"..  *******In political jargon, a useful idiot is a person perceived as a propagandist for a cause the goals of which they are not fully aware of, and who is used cynically by the leaders of the cause.******Mr. Trump is a bufoon....Foul language on both side doesn't alter the fact that Trump is a bottom feeder."Maybe my friends kids should go back to primary school and learn english then all will be fine."

They really need to add a Stupid button to the React options.*sigh* 
Tiresome, John....very tiresome.  And untrue.  As usual.... and rich spoiled baby morons ... it really seems Cheetolini is focused on REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS when not golfing and fondling the French.You fat ugly old men threatening these poor people with loosing their kids and violence is sick. You are godless... who gives a shit if they have a club who believes weird stuff, happens all the time., we need togetherness, the intelligent people teach the slower ones! the key to life isn't how large of a skyscraper some autistic person can build! omg are all people in colorado this disgusting? quit making fun of these people, when you point at them you are projecting your own low self esteem .... I don't even know what to say, do you people think this is funny? It's not funny, and your not cool. newsflash, there is a god, which is probably why you all sit at home alone every night. patheticIdiots like these give hunters a bad name. A reward might cause someone to come forward. They probably bragged about it.All are nasty nasty jews except for colbert, but he is married to a jew-- nasty peoplecan we just exterminate this scumbag already?  every miserable breath he takes is a slap in the face to people who understand the privilege of parenthood.Yeah but in the political theater, where is the fun in saying he was a jerk?  Racist, sexist ageist bigot, now that has some cache.Never underestimate the power of idiots in large groups.Don't bankrupt our state with this stupid BS 21 corporate welfare garbage.  Vote these Senators out!Donald and his quislings are so cartoonishly inept that nuance and subtlety are not necessary to describe them.
Where do you think these young and impressionable yoot should get their info?How many of these left wing losers are being paid to do this?Here is a better idea, reduce the tax, & regulatory burden so that the U.S. companies are not forced to look elsewhere in order to survive.
 Unfortunately, the Obama Democrats are economic idiots, who view those that create  jobs as, at best, a cash cow to be milked to death, at worst, the enemy.My comment was deleted.

Screw you censors!, islam is a problem and so are you!It's all the same clowns they just change rings...Sometimes a joke is just misogynistic drivel spouted by stupid, arrogant guys.oh more left wing stupidity ... colleges need to focus on educating and leave policy to the grown ups, like trump who is not banning anyone but suspending things until such a time as those all but non functioning governments can get thier acts together and work with the usa on proper vetting..The delusional, mentally impoverished, pathological liar just can't quit. How long before this malignant narcissist continues his rantings is the time it takes to remove him from his presidential playpen. His chief sycophant and apologist, Paul Ryan, says "He's just learning". Learning to lie or learning to be president? Either one is a fool's errand.the aclu would hire the priciest lawyers they could find to defend the endless parade of idiots we have here. the criminals best friend is these morons.Agreed. I wouldn't call Trump an idiot - just an embarrassingly uninformed, ignorant, inarticulate, bumbling nincompoop. POTUS, in its first 100 days, is fast on its way to losing all credibility.The comments against illegals being deported after killing us citizens proves that liberals are mentally ill.wow you clearly are a paid lib troll from our taxes to spew that childish stupidity.. a good job????my god you are a lunaticYou've managed to say something so idiotic you've become the most hated person in the room. Good work.Richard, for all your preaching about the moral high ground over the years in these comments, I'm actually surprised you're a supporter of a thrice-married adulterer and conman. This is a man who looks at women like they are objects and is purely motivated by money and ego. He has lied more than any other public official in my lifetime, your grandchildren and great-grandchildren will read about Trump in history books and wonder what the hell your generation was thinking.  

You don't like Sanders or Clinton, I get it but you're the one who chose to sacrifice your morality by supporting scum like Donald Trump. He's literally gone on record to mock the church countless times, but he has an R by his name so you and others think he's God's gift to government.

I wouldn't trust Trump to date my daughter, and I sure as hell don't trust him to lead our country.

*For the record, I hate Trump but him walking away from TPP was the only good thing he's done since elected.Gay folk don't define themselves by sexual acts any more than heterosexuals to. It is the sodomy-obsessed gay-haters who try to impose such a definition.Hide all the gays & LesbiansWhat a bunch of idiots!! Just look at the picture behind the excavator?? There is no flood, no raging river from bank to bank!! But only a small part of a river running against the east shore of the Matanuska!
What about the 80 percent of the river bed that is dry in the background???
The state of Alaska is spending 1 million dollars for quote: 1,100L x 70W x  6 T a wall to help stop the erosion! At this rate it will cost around 5 million dollars a mile and that's only along the bike path, not protecting any private properties??
Here is my idea that would save the state and mat-su borough hundreds of millions of dollars and property owners of there valuable land and homes!!
Stop the robbing the gravel from valuable dry land like where they are loading trains and start  mining the river beds! Problem Solved!  Just divert the river to the center of the 1/2 mile dry river bed would solve this!! OH THE FISH??? Well all greenys should not live in homes or drive cars if that's how they feel!China's rudeness to Obama reflects China's rudeness. It says nothing about our President and everything about the Chinese. The idea that a nation as powerful as ours should respond to diplomatic rudeness with violence is the kind of thin-skinned stupidity that got us into multiple wars under Bush and will, if Trump is elected get us into nuclear war with everyone. The world knows the US under President Obama will defend itself; it's under no illusions about that. The civilized world will take Obama over Xi, Trump or any other self-styled, third world thug masquerading as a true leader.The only ones who favor this are educated morons who have never ran a business in their life, have absolutely no idea what it takes to make payroll much less create jobs, because the only thing they have ever ran is their mouth and frankly they suck at that too. Unions are the ones backing this profound stupidity as they are masters at killing business and jobs while bankrupting communities. They are bound and determined to return Oregon to the days we were known as Tax He11, USA and were in recession year after year running high unemployment.It's a shame that it's going to be years before they can stick a needle in this moron's arm.These liberals don't care about us! They want us to cover their over spending, and stupid ideas! When we're out of money to live on, they'll just move on!Its not the neighbors its the stupidity of the judge.Trudeau is full of crap. The truth is he only lost interest in electoral reform when it was pointed out to His Royal Anus that it wouldn't give the Liberals the unfair advantage he sought.I recall in the old days, the Apple flock immediately bought whatever Jobs told them to. Are they still that stupid?I hope he fires this inept AG. He never should have been appointed in the first place. He's so "old school" in everything he does and thinks. Please resign. Please please please resign.The motorcycle on shoulder lane is just plain STUPID.The US Air Force is awesome!

Trump is an idiot.Haha. What a collection of dumb*asses. Fishilly, mcwilly, dumbweazy, fasheezy, bye beezy!who said stupidity was not dangerous... thanks Justinnotch, i dont know, but im pretty sure they were assholes, totally disconnected with the reality of being poor and probably never met a poor person.No. quite silly actuallyYou have a long wait ahead of you, dummy.Exactly. These scandalous groups plan this crap while the average person knows not what goes on.So you don't like restaurants that pander to all of those white christian immigrants from Europe?

Or are you some sort of dumb racist that thinks only non-whites are immigrants?You sir are the moron.  The rules are being followed.  You do not like the rules.  Last government did not change themYeh, let's send those idiots on " Whale Wars" in to bungle things up even more....

Good idea.according to Marx, everyone should have the same crappy life... except if you work in the ruling class... the government...  never get fired, wages higher than private sector, great health and retirement benefits... and because you are so large, you can control the government with coercion and votes. isn't it getting wonderful? all hail mediocritySullivan supports a racist for President of the United States.Not bragging about my income in the slightest, Janette, just responding to the tired, illiterate rant about free stuff that seems to be the beginning and end of what Trump supporters can talk about.  Oh, and if you want some facts about voting demographics, wander on over to fivethirtyeight.com.  And yes, I'm going to continue to insult Trump and his supporters.  Because bigots, misogynists, racists and bullies are disgusting.Probably something petty for which some low IQ idiot thought it worth shooting at cops over.brad12>  The only "imbecile" that is being recognized is YOU!!!!  Trump is way smarter than you so don't forget that now.What is the matter with you globeandmail? Do you expect me to ever pay for your newspaper again when you put out such baised stories.

When a driver is intoxicated, they are  guity no matter what. When a young woman becomes intoxicated, everone else is guilty no matter what. Such a blanant double standard is systemic positive discrimation. Everything thay your saying is hypocritical!!I don't think it's the money they're looking for.  They want to live in the US and be good citizens.  Not like the white trash that went up to Virginia, deport them.What a completely idiotic comment,.Not a single NRA member was involved in this shooting.  You are a blankenyblank idiot.Apparently many Catholics have never heard of the Gospel. They are opinionated, conceited, arrogant and with just enough education to be stupid but with no excuse for their mendacity because they have enough information at their disposal to know better. 
    I am challenged to defend the Church in discussion with socially conscious and compassionate others who may have, for what may be good reasons, an intrinsic bias against the institutional church while having a high regard for Pope Francis. 
   Mr. Winter's article gives me reason to hope that the cause is not lost.Can you imagine if they did this in their own countries?  These idiots should have been put on a bus to the southern border or even to Canada.Phillips will sell gay couples a standard, out-of-the-cooler, sheet cake.
He refuses to design any wedding cake for gay couples. A service he offers to ANY straight couple who walks through the door.
That's discrimination.
If Phillips refused to design cakes for inter-racial couples you'd be condemning him. But because he refuses to design cakes for gay couples, you're fine with it.Of course the comment you refer to is more funny than anything else, but basically it is some sort of underhand advertising.  I think it is meant to illustrate that this comment section does not want to provide a forum for advertising especially not to witchdoctors and penis enlargers. I fully agree with that.Wow!!!!  One of the most stupid comments I have ever seen.Unfortunately we become more and more desensitized to this baboon's idiotic nonsense. Good on the sports heroes for openly rejecting his stupidity. They have a platform from which to do so.......The whiners are so pathetic.  Most of them do not even live in Denver.  Because they HATE city life.  Or so they proudly tell us.

I love the life in Denver and that is why I live there.  This is a good investment in a GREAT city!THIS JUST IN: The President is still a dick.Oh, Bleaty Hater?  Please elucidate exactly what your "fix" for stupid would be.  I can't wait to see your back peddling.you are a nut job Old, and as usual ignorant of realityRussian patsy, my hairy ass! Go back to your cave, Communist.Its only 49 % of our budget here on the Rock.
It used to be 33 % until Chretien unloaded costs to the provinces  15 years ago.
The surplus was used to fund Adscam.

Now its being used for $1.1 million offices for the LPC ministers and for JT swimming pool and for anything extraneous to the well being of taxpayers.

So, suck it up baby .

You voted these idiots into office..The Deli should get rid of those evil gambling machines.   They attract lowlifes:  Very detestable and dirty people of low moral character.What would the Liberals and the media do if they didn't have the Conservatives to blame everything on?  Trudeau has been south of the border selling his ray of sunshine bs ever since elected.....and now the big bad Conservatives are to blame for Trudeau and Co.'s bizarre hushed, over the top, and fast tracked payment to Khadr.    Like that would never make it to the US papers..........seriously pathetic.I am Canadian, born and raised and also know French. I suggest you go back to school, stupid.Propaganda of homosexuality should be forbidden.Killing western supporters of terrorists is not a problem, but a solution.The stupid is strong among Trump Chumps today.Charismatic flake needs to keep his stupid yap shut.Being a dick must be yours.whaaaaa, cry babies who dont respect democracy,, losers !Today, with 21st century news 24/7, inside a democracy, I'd say it's just ... stupid.Trudeau is the biggest, most arrogant liar.Kick her in the stomach Angela! Then punch her in the face. Try to do as much physical damage as you can to the girl. Yeaaaaaa! Smash her nose...If they don't like death threats (when they do stupid stuff), then go back to California (where doing stupid stuff is the norm).Stealing is what  you do best.If you sit in the student section and you are not a student then you get what you deserve. You are stupid.I work for the State of Hawaii , need I not say more.  Get a life.  Please do not comment to me anymore your ignorant is very disturbing.I stand corrected by NeoLiberal.

Among unreconstructed Marxists, failed Trotskyites,  ex-KGB officers and the naive "Useful Idiots" regarded so fondly by Vladimir Lenin, Pravda is respected around the world.Get rid of the jerk. Canada has had enough of his greedy little ways. Bring in a gentleman like Gretzky or Orr to properly run the NHL.Need a citation, fool.'
Trump is nothing but a belligerent, insecure and childish buffoon.

(…and a petty treasonous and traitorous con man.)

He's surrounded himself with racist white nationalist neo-Nazis,

…and with this meeting he's only trying to paint a picture he doesn't fit within.

.
Resist Trump.  

Resist his agenda.

.I'm not allowed to cross the border anyway for something that happened in 1986. No sweat off my assthe GOP had 8 years to come up with plan, 
DISPLAYS how stupid adn bankrupt their ideology is  !Don't make me laugh... Brandon didn't do a damn thing except have a 10 minute meeting with the police chief over tea & crumpets. He's just as ignorant and stupid as the rest of the knee benders.are you stupid?  we are all discussing the current plan of 20 miles, 21 station.  there is not discussion about any route to manoa.Except Trump has no real idea about whats at stake because he's an idiot.Brooks is a traitorous moron.A new era for protest music, but who’s listening? Or gives a damn?Right wing nuts are stupid. Proven fact. Liberals, in the other hand, aren't. 
I guess that makes them a little harder to fool and control, eh, Herr Fuhrer?... the skits write themselves, really scary we have such GARBAGE IN THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND ...They did not have a permit to parade on Friday night. Therefore the permit the nazi/neo confederate racists had to rally on Saturday was revoked. The anti fascist/nazi/racist organizers were given a permit to demonstrate their opposition to fascist racist bigotry on Saturday. That's the legal rally that the murderous idiot drove his car into. Once again trump had his information wrong, perhaps intentionally? A lot of that good old intentional and willfully ignorance going on around this  country seems like.hahaha Yeah we dont do dumb ass shit like this....we are real criminals who help the economy that these citizens suck dry.There was no $50 million gazebo.  Why not try a little research because you are making yourself look foolish. 
BTW the G7 summit came in at over $400 million UNDER BUDGET according to the auditor general.It's not surprising that you pathetically pivoted to the "illegal" conversation given the current political climate. I'm sorry that it's so hard for you to relate to the heroism and selflessness this man demonstrated that night. This HUMAN BEING may have prevented countless casualties at the expense of his future physical and mental well-being and here you are spewing nothing but petulant attacks and hateful rhetoric. You are disgusting.Apparently you are clueless to. She called Trump a hypocrite because he did not stand when the song for lowering the flag was being played. I am saying he does not have to because he is inside a building. DUHHHHH.Since he had thousands of these pictures, how about we just toss him into a cage-fighting arena with say, the top two or three lottery winner fathers who would like to discuss the pictures of their daughters with him.

We could charge admission and give the proceeds to his victims.  

"Highlights at 11:00!"  

See the teeth fly!  See the blood spurt!  Oh, wow! His little thingy didn't like that kick!

There should be consequences for being a piece of garbage!How childish of Rickie boy!  Some one sees the American flag displayed in an inappropriate manner and simply lets the other person know!  And what does Rickie boy do?  Responds with something saying the equivalent of "at least I have one."  How moronic!Nothing like having a jackass for a president.Oh, there's that tired old false dichotomy again.  

There's more than one way to build a building  --  the Bullitt Center has demonstrated that a large building can actually generate more energy than it consumes.

But you just go ahead and sneer  --  it's clearly great fun to be ignorant by choice.I see no reason why any one, especially a Mexican, needs to go before an immigration judge.  They have nothing to fear from their government and escaping crime is no reason for asylum.  This gal from Peru is only here for economic reasons, again no reason to let her stay.... and he needs to shave that stupid goatee. I can't think anyone in that locker room can take him seriously when every time they look at him they just see an idiot.Garbage decision.   Power play by OIA.   This is HIGH SCHOOL sports. These administrators
treat Football like they are NFL owners. Paying public should boycott attending games.  Will force
administrators to rethink their GARBAGE decision.  Students are the losers.Stupid and regressive. Look it up, "It not."This man is a fool.  The picture of Gen. Kelly with his head in his hands tells all.  God help us allDon't tell the Demo rats! Let them keep running him!cabinet full of losers.obviously this asshole grouped and assaulted Taylor Swift. His actions are the only things that are preventing him from attaining a job elsewhere. Wow. This behavior cannot be excepted and I cant wait for the judge to award Taylor and make him pay all the lawyer fees.Is this Trump ( idiot ) going to go around bullying every institution that he finds "offensive"........with the office of the President and his "potential" power.  Protesters aren't Berkley's fault, and life is full of s it.  I don't condone the violence at all...but it is not the President's job to go around addressing every "evil", and micro managing the country, and playing judge, jury, and executioner threatening to cut off funds for "this and that".  Sheesh, America, wake up....you have a mad man in the White House...and worse, he is an uneducated STUPID mad man..the worst kind.She won't get the uneducated white male vote. 

Trump LOVES the poorly educated.franco:  you're an idiot.And Trump's a deflector, liar, and criminal.oh save it loser, no one is forced to fly on an airplane but we all have to use electricity, man you lib trolls will make any excuse to justify the most incompetent file mess the ontario liberals have done to ontario!you forget i go to crappy tire centre for a sen leaf games and the fans hated him and called him slow pylon phagoof. now he is their saviour. Hypocrites. 
I like these emojees, like splashing them aroundISIS has called the Chump an idiot. Can't wait for his twitter reply. Hope he has a flashlight because it's mighty dark under his bed in the White House."So Alaskans are too dumb to know what risks to take and not take where our own environment is concerned?"
I don't think that's his point at all.  Ever heard of the "Tragedy of the Commons."  It isn't an aspect of smart or dumb but just aspects of human nature and "enlightened self-interest."No, they would not! Russia is a haven for some of the best hackers in the world and teaming with the Russian cyber-security people would be selling the farm as the US provides the missing bits of information that Russia needs to dominate the internet. This is an idiotic notion no matter who suggested it and is particularly problematical given the possibility that Trump may already have colluded with the Russians against his own country.If you come at me with a knife and I have a gun, I will shoot you.Weekday idiot, and you compared populations sizes, and liberal cesspools and suicide and accidents and  other means of death and .................Everyone associated with doing this to these young girls I hope that you all rot in hell!  It was hard to watch I can not imagine being the young girl held down by full grown men.  Disgusting!keep living in your left wing stupidity, there will be a market for our OIL from the SANDS  for generationsYou can't fix stupidAny CEO that associates themselves and their company with the stupidest president ever should be targeted with a boycott. 

He isn't a president, he's an ignorant foll who managed to acquire enough votes from some very stupid and ignorant people. What a joke the US has become.Not nearly as many accidents as those caused by impatient and stupid drivers.No. I'm saying YOU don't care. Conservatives don't give a crap, and only use gun violence in Chicago as an idiotic point to try to score in a losing argument. 

Child, please.This is the key insight with Trump. 

He’s just genuinely one of the worst human being imaginable. 

If you think of amost *any* character trait – not even in politics, just in life – he’s awful. 

He’s stupid, ignorant, arrogant, racist, lacks any compassion, insulting, has no sense of reciprocity. 

He doesn’t care about the rule of law. 

He openly praises tyrants and despises democrats. 

He is openly wasteful and hateful but demands that no one take a cent from him or insult him in any way. 

Never earned anything, inherited his wealth. 

He only ever punches down, and only ever uses his power to aggrandize and help himself, never to help others. 

Not to mention he’s a sexual predator who has run through trophy wifes and appears to have raised monstrous children.and the hater of left wing stupidity never ends.. psss bud such behavior happens on both sides of the political isle"we simply cannot leave our future in the hands of those who may be misinformed or misguided,” Sen. J. Kalani English (D)".
But the monument ocean grab by people on the East Coast in DC just fine with you clowns.
"“In Hawaii, we understand why it’s important to take care of our land, ocean and air — our way of life depends on it,” Hirono said".
Tell me more about rail, you hypocrite."The only ones pushing to reject Trump are the sore losers, liberal left and the media."

I call them patriots.  The "will of the people" is a rejection of Trump, but the will of a minority is forcing us into dangerous, monumentally stupid territory.Boyle was/is a fool. Who in their right mind takes a pregnant wife for a backpack trip through Afghanistan and then tries to cook up a story about distributing aid. Those who believe this are as foolish as Boyle and Canadians need to wake up to the realities of life and start taking responsibility for same rather than whining when they become stuck in one of earth's hellholes.Elise, Kennedy, Agnew, and Nixon were nowhere near as damaging to our international standing as the current clown is.  They were just crooked liars looking out for their own interests.  Trump is way beyond that.  Visions of grandeur and so forth.  Sessions?  He's at most a month away from resigning.He's crazy like a fox, for sure.Check out those unis....we look stupid and suck doing it!!! FFH now!!!Bull shit he should be in prison, Obama and Hillary same cell.A goofy government in Alberta up against an even goofier one in BC. Nothing more ridiculous than that.And Americans wonder why they are seen as the worlds idiots."...my statement is an insult to idiots everywhere." I guess she did not find anything worthy to write about.Who the hell are you to call Rob Ford a disgusting human being!? You make me sick!!!Liberals are promoting stupid.  It gets them votes.Get yourself checked for Trump Derangement Syndrome.
You have all the symptoms.

The more you know..."It can't possibly be related in any way to the illegals living in the state." You were being facetious when you said this, meaning that you blame illegals for the crime in this state. You don't have to be explicit with me. Yep, those damn illegals--the best excuse for your failed life since sliced white breadMAN I will be glad when that asshole is out of officeThey can shot in the air, they can shot the legs. It was clear that he had not reached into the vehicle yet. There are options to shooting to killSave the planet from nuclear holocaust by starting one? ...idiot.That POS tRump took an oath of office to uphold the laws of the United States and to protect Americans. The Affordable Care Act is LAW. All he has done since getting elected by the electoral college is roll back environmental regulations that protect Americans from pollution and now he wants to take healthcare away from 32 MILLION Americans. tRump works for Steve Bannon of Breitbart whose openly stated goal is to destroy the federal government to enrich the already filthy rich. Disgusting.What a disgusting little loser.  Please go away McCain.  You're disgusting.Its a good thing the Broncos were so focus that the Won....... Oh wait they Lost? Well at east the steelers had their head on too.... What they lost too? Maybe if you guys would focus on the damn game I wouldn't be so pissed off that you guy sucked today.damn cyclists think they own the roadsYou are truly witless.Mittens beat gloves for sure, but the army ones suck. OR or Black Dimond. I hate it when people look for the lightest warmest glove. "But I need to use my fingers" what are you a two year old? Fools! They walk away all mad, go ahead and get frostbite becuse you're too cheap and stupid to buy what works, mittens.Yeah, and the WH didn't blackmail Joe and Mika either. I mean, if you believe this lying dumpster fire of a "president".All I can see then, is that the purpose of the interpreter was to allow him to play stupid for the judge. And the point I made, is that he has been here for 32 years and of course he knew better.Uh yea...Look i've had several friends that own pitbulls, non of them are aggressive most of them won't even snap at a fly that repeatedly lands on their nose. Dogs are much like humans, most cases of aggressive dogs are because of the way they were brought up, either through abuse or neglect or just asshole people who go "omg it's a pit bull I have fucking down syndrome so let me hit this dog with a stick because i'm sick in the head." Shame on you people for trying to sentence an entire breed of dog to death which isn't even the dog's fault it's almost always certainly the owners fault. You guys are just as bad as the KKK clans from back after the revolutionary war. Fucking disgusting people you are.Yeah, it's a little weird isn't it?  "Will your driving record be clear, or have less than 2 points against it?  Oh yeah, it's good! they answer. It comes back with 2 dui's, and one point left after various other things.  Can you pass a drug test? you ask. Sure, they say, as they take the kit to the testing agency, and never return.  Hispanics are much more likely to pass these things and be hireable, if only they prove citizenship.  White trash is hard to qualify with employer's insurance companies.I guess the Russians undermined Bernies campaign and wrote Hillary's idiotic emails.Bank fraud Bernie, typical Demonrat crook-hypocrite.Sorry, you can't spin something this stupid no matter how hard you try.
Trudeau is an idiot, some of us knew this years ago.....Donald Trump is far from a failed businessman, what a stupid uneducated argument.When one sees Justin Trudeau in action the following adjectives come to mind: disingenuous, ignorant, insincere, hypocritical, naive, sanctimonious, slimy, sleazy, smarmy, smirking, sneering, superficial, uneducated.How much do outfits like those kids are wearing cost? Do parents have to lay down cash for them? How ridiculous.So, I guess white-skinned  latinos descended from Spanish Europeans aren't allowed in your special fraternity?? That screams of hypocracy.I guess I now understand why Brandon Marshall was always kneeling..."Please help us not get our ass kicked Lord!"Well gosh darn it!  I worried about the unknown costs, unknown fare price, unknown power source and costs, reasons why this project was "sold to us" as $5 Billion versus the actual cost probably 3 times that, and a potentially perpetual rail tax that won't be enough for the O & M.

After reading your article I feel much better.........and know that everything's under control.Stupidity loves company.American idiots.Rally 'round the insane cheeto boy's, the nut job wants to start Armageddon. The only people who will rally around this a**clown, are the idiots who voted for this insane jacka**. They can't be wrapped real tight either.Hey ms.amylou, you are rude, you call names, you are mean spirited much of the time, as are most Trump supporters.  I haven't seen you telling your nasty buddies to stop their nasty little jabs.  You can start with Nick Travis and waveamaker. 99.9%of the comments I review on here are "mean spirited" remarks by Trump supporters so don't presume to lecture me.  Got it?The malignant narcissist and mentally deficient sociopath warmongers, spouts excrement, and slowly destroys the country with his stupidity and his suckees, like Pruitt. The GOP loves it.Isn't it comforting to know that a pathological narcissistic liar is "leading" this great nation?  A squadron of A-10s might be reassuring to the ground forces right now...As Bruce Springsteen has said " Trump is a moron".  I couldn't agree more.yup, a left winger of dumbIdiot.Tugging at heartstrings?
You sound like a third rate country music tavern singer pounding out third rate songs.
Collect your lobbying pay some other way, you're inept at this method.Trump isn't a fighter. He's a parasite. Enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3un052mvlJISo "f*** you all", "kiss my a--" and calling out a population on the basis of their 'race' is now considered part of civil dialogue and acceptable debate. 

It is offensive when coming from right wing 'supremacists', it is offensive coming from a left-oriented 'progressive'. 

Essentially, Dal officials have stripped away the moral platform to pursue such degrading thought and language from either side. Hardly progressive and certainly no victory.There is no appropriate space for this Trump clown in Canada. Buffoons belong to a circus show but this O`leary has nothing to offer in both official languages across Canada.Oh for goodness sakes, just bugger off! I bet you are not South African but another bot somewhere in Saharanpur! Quite simply, just voetsek! I am sick to hell of anything and everything gupta. You are not from our Indian community.  Ja, my father is Indian.
Don't associate that filthy bunch with our communities in SA. And in case you did not notice...Pravin Gordhan is Indian too and you lot let BLF, ANCYL (read: gupta dogs of war) loose on him . T'sek!Great,  Didn't we have enough problems with that idiot trying up air traffic last September?MC Cain and his fornicating tramp marriage breaking wife are traitors to the founding principles of our nation.  Way past time for this cadaverous old senile fool to go far away.They both deserve the death penalty.and the title will be, how i was the most useless president in modern history!this act is a pile of shitSo somebody who is just waiting to crap on the team, I suppose it makes little difference. To an actual baseball fan, it's a world of difference.Limited entry was and is a rip-off of the people of Alaska. As are taxi cab permits and liquor licenses and pot licenses. Anytime corrupt government imposes some type of protectionism they choose winners (usually themselves) at the expense of everyone else. The scammers are in charge.What a total piece of crap! No doubt this 'Todd Simmons' is a died in the wool liberal with the brains of a gnat. The liberals that Hawaii have sent to congress are a bunch of lame brained idiots that can't think for themselves. Thinking that having Killary as President would be a good thing is off the charts! Obama has been the most bazaar and destructive president we have EVER had, his race baiting has divided Americans and set us back decades and the madness he has created in America would be carried on by Killary. Having more liberal justices will only contribute the decline of the America many of us grew up in and love. A liberal tax and spend congress would put us further into debt that our GRAND CHILDREN will be responsible for. Clinton as president be a good thing - WHAT A CROCK!!"Garbage WE now pay for". How much state tax did you contribute in the past three years?No, not in Chugiak silly. That's only an average of 10 per state. Doesn't seem unreasonable.ok trump haters, lets see you crap on this one! first trump slams iran then they buy 30 jets, making jobs in america! ya go trump goaa poor left wing nutter, can not debate on the facts as i posted so it is the usual right to insult again. why don't you try and argue against my facts rather than look like a complete idiot?More far right rubbish. First up, it's obvious that you haven't a clue about real estate, housing and finance, so let's dispense with that.

Second, the so called 'free speech' you're bleating about only extends to bullying bigots- who scream like bratty children when football and basket ball players silently protect the fact that all over the country, cops are killing unarmed people who are no threat, but happen to be of a different color than you.

When anyone fights back against bullies, they show cowardly character- again and again, just like Georgie Porgie of the nursery rhyme.Damn liberals  ruining the country one step at a time, I hope morneau needs a doctor soon and can not get oneYou are just a stick buthole!At least he didn't say something truly vile like "I want to grab her pussy". President Trump!!!!China is a horrible military dictatorship hiding under the Communist Party of China ! 

What's not to love!Is  LBB  Barry  back  from  his  gay  sex romp  in   the  south  seas  yet?   When  he  left Moochelle at  home?How many Jewish-majority countries are there in the world?  One, with a total population of barely 10 million.

And that country is a constitutional democracy, with full rights and freedoms for all its people, including those who aren't Jewish.

Sorry, your analogy is ridiculous.Haha, I thought the whole point of chemtrails was to keep people stupid, so they'd vote for..... wait for it....Trump said Mexico would pay for his idiotic wall. No cheque from Banco de Mexico ? No wall. The American gocernment has more important things to waste money on, like jets that do not fly and boats that do not float.I bought a solar powered flashlight,darn thing doesn't work at night.It's not a "great way" in the least.  Requiring someone to live at their workplace is both laughable and ridiculous.Fine clear commentary.  Despite the twaddle in the comments section spreading unverifiable calumny about Hillary Clinton, Trump is a dangerous idiot who needs to be kicked back to the fringes where he belongs.  Hopefully today will do that job.Sick fukin bitch ... lock her upIt's time for the rest of the world to come first. So much for the big, fat, orange buffoon.Caldwell is a white collar criminal and perpetual con man.What kind of shameless must you be

A pussy-grabbing orange-haired rat;

Sunlit investigation shows

You do realize what the 'U' in UN stands for - Useless!Charge him with attempted murder, then smear him in whale fat and stake him to a pole in Barrow. I hate to see my tax money wasted on stupid people in jailYes I got the similar warnings before. I usually vote everything by one yes button since I have no interest to judge other's comments. And it is kind of strange if G&M has made up its mind on particular comment why it needs reader's inputs? They regularly delete comments including mine's in this thread, and they are bothered by people's voting? Kind of ridiculous.Hey Parnell, the pussy grabbing stuff ... I do believe its FACTUAL.How sad and pathetic that there are individuals out there that have nothing better to do. Good for them that I'm sure their souls are being prayed for (generously) AND bad for them--go for the DNA. I'm sure one of the idiots wore the cap!I'll vote Gary Johnson before I vote for a liar or a scumbag.why are APD cops so incompetent when it comes to subduing suspects,how about we look at other sttates and see what they do....then we can re implement the new program,while we watch and see success.......our force is like,well its unlike anywhere else it seems,with all the mismanaged monies and resources,we need a cop shop overhaul.....mabee like atl falcons front line defense,some big ole boys/w big ole boots.....and experiance....these 145 # rooks are having a go at it,it seems anyways...all the awnsers are clear,on our problems.i just dont get why they havent been relegated,delegated and actively in force.still we play tiddley winks.....seems simple yet stupid running stupid....That idiot doctor got millions.. why settle for $30?  Ann sue the shiite out of this crappy airline.Trudeau talks absolute nonsense. It's embarrassing to listen to him.Keep your politics out of my vagina!!!!I'm surprised Justin won't go with Ross Rebagliati. They both share a passion for snowboarding and weed. Ross likes gold (medal) and Justin prefers silver (spoon). But I'll take Payette over those others, that's for damn sure.The people who go to these 3rd world areas knowing the dangers of the on coming hurricanes and choose to stay, then complain about he Canadian government.....well they are patheticShe's a bald faced liar and an embarrassment to the Republican party and Alaska.Bullshit. 

Let's clear the fog right now. When you were making the city "financially stable" you laid off an entire background recruiting section because they wouldn't let you lay off the 30 officers you planned to eliminate because of push-back. You only held academies when you were campaigning, which you HAD to because officers were retiring early because of your awful administrative oversight of public safety. You forced the Gang Task Force to be eliminated and put a moratorium on related training, dropping SWAT is 1/2 of the staff it used to be. Burglary became a Patrol Officer job, not for Detectitives - eg: No Followup. 

APD was purposely understaffed during your tenure - 408 officers dropped to 320. And you have the balls to take credit for our current uptick in employment. I'm so glad you're gone. I wish it had happened four years earlier. Now please go completely away.Silly rabbit.  
That's not where it starts in most cases like this.
It starts with an individual breaking the law.
Then police are called.
It then proceeds to said individual threatening police after they engage him/her.
From there it follows basic police procedure.

It's simple really. 

Hundreds of people interact with police officers on a daily basis and make good decisions and wake up the next morning.
A few don't.You are 100% correct!   We need to stop wasting tax payer money on emergency services for people who can't see past I, MY, & ME.  Since adverse weather conditions are just too much of an inconvenience we need to let these people "freely" demonstrate their arrogance/stupidity and allow nature to cull the herd.  
Like Trump I'm saying just exactly what I'm thinking.Silly Sue, it would appear to me that the legislature is running the oil tax credits and reduced revenues, not the governor.Man, whoever wrote this originally is a real jerk.Wilson is pure trash.  Typical Dem  POS.Pathetic, self-regarding twaddle.I'm paying $10 bucks a month for a newspaper that writes about this piece of shit TV show? Even tv websites don't waste pixels on this crap.I have seen several letters published by the RG that I'm quite sure would be flagged on this site.    I find that strange.  

I haven't tracked it closely, but at times I believe the RG will pick particular nausea inducing letters from a conservative view to make conservatives look bad.   I definitely can't prove that.   (I thought the Des Moines Register did the same at times)    I know Limbaugh loves to find a complete idiot to make all liberals look stupid.So let me get this straight.....

This numb-nuts decided to sleep out in the wilderness where bears live and a being a bear, acted like a bear.  So based on this, the bear is exterminated.  So can we then please castrate this future presidential candidate from the left wing so he can't contaminate the rest of the gene pool??

ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!Trudeau, terrified of offending Quebeckers. We all know that if this was happening in Alberta or Manitoba he'd be climbing all over the cameras denouncing it. What a loser.Useful idiotsBasking in your ignorance.OK, so-called Last Patriot, what about Catholic priests that hide behind their collar as they're raping children and they just get moved from parish to parish.  Isn't this the height of hypocrisy?  And what about the Catholic gay or lesbian church member.  Don't they have rights too?  This issue will wind back up in the US Supreme Court where it needs to be.typical empty stupid reply based on hate over anything constructiveand a full of crap hater spews the usual stupidityOne thing has become abundently clear ..... Paul Ryan is an idiot.the clowns are ignorant sheep of the left living in hate like you while trump is working and succeeding for the usa. how about less focus on trump and more on our pathetic leadershipAnother theft by the communist gov. of Canada.
Just to spread his isis support to murder Canadians.
Get rid o them, notley, winnie, clark, trudeau, vote
these thieves out and lets have a populist gov. These
animals get in and we will have nothing but murders
everywhere. And now Canada is trying to stop people
from speaking out.hey loser, you were attempting to discredit him based on some fantasy not sessions good work, but as usual lefties hate being exposed for posting stupidity,He's the KING! The LYING KING! And he WILL NOT be crossed! 

What a fool! The sad thing is that our president is a 15 year old brat in a fat, old haggard man body.Just retire again goatee and this time for good. You're embarrassing yourself.What a completely idiotic letter. Do you REALLY think that conserving energy in an office will keep trees from falling on power lines in an ice storm?

I've been without power for five days, too. Crews have been out twice and they apparently cannot find the problem. I hope they do, soon.

In the meantime, I hope you will stop pestering them on the phone. It helps no one.The only incompetent was Harper.Yes he is an idiot but even worse, he is dangerous.  I understand he is off his meds.Is this really how ignorant you are? Or is there more?A politically stupid move on Trump's part. The reality is that the Paris accord does very little in reality ... I mean, trying to limit the  heating to 2 degrees is  too little in any case ... chances are, what we have already dumped into the climate system will take us above 2 degrees anyway, and, really, that alone would be catastrophic for the environment, leading to major droughts, bouts of extreme weather and melting ice that will flood Florida and some major cities over the next few decades.

But by opting of an international agreement (that he can't *** really*** opt out of anyway, he is declaring that he doesn't care about his own grandchildren, never mind yours. He is denying that the ice caps are melting and he's declaring that he doesn't give a damn if they are.

Politically, this is not a very wise move, ON TOP of the fact that it is politically unwise to discourage the growing green energy sector that is worth billions of dollars.Oh bull crap. You got a bunch of democrats elected and now you think you will get refunded. Sadly, you are probably right.Hey Eric ...it's been proven that the people inciting violence at the Trump Rally's were sent there and were paid for their services by the Clinton Campaign and so far it looks like everyone knows it except you. So when you try to extend the idea that it was Trump doing it you look both ill informed of the facts and sillyThey can shuffle the cabinet seven ways from Sunday and it's still a cabal of losers.I don't back terrorism.  And furthermore, I don't back Obama's casual dismissiveness and failure to act when he clearly stated that the use of chemical weapons would not be tolerated.  How many more needless deaths in Syria would you like to see before we can  finally put an end to this?  Or are you one of those who supports hospital bombings?

The real question is why do you insist on sticking your head in the sand and pretending everything is tickety-boo in the world today?  By the way, that's exactly the type of thing which Neville Chamberlain advocated and did before WW2 and we all saw how that situation ending up getting resolved.  

History is doomed to be repeated when fools like yourself ignore what's happening.  I'm not suggesting another World War, but under no circumstances should this Syrian Civil War ever have gotten to the point it is today... especially if Obama and his administration had exhibited the backbone to act decisively back in 2012.Can't explain yourselves can you globe.
You are assuredly turning into a useless rag.
Explain it, why telling it as I see it, that is
a man in the picture. Or is it you couldn't get
a woman dumb enough to be photographed
for your dumb journalists, if they can be called journalists.I am watching Goodale on TV giving statements about this. He is such an ass. What a slime bucket.  i hope he knows the depth of disgust he is creating for himself and his most beloved Justin trudeau. Will the media  hold Trudeau to task as Prime Minister and ask  questions him real questions when he gets back from his Pride Parade across Europe?  Or will they  ask him low ball questions about the weather to save him embarrassment of looking like an idiot."loose talk"????

I'll have you know, NP5491, that I chose those words very, very carefully. 

I watched, I thought about it, and I came to the conclusion that Trump is an idiot.

Just because well foundationed, rational and justifiable description doesn't fit into your fantasies of a world actually ruled by Trump, doesn't mean they aren't well foundationed, rational and justifiable.

One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:

"a foolish or stupid person"

So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.

Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.

Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not).Trump is about as dumb about Putrid Rasputin as he is about the environment. Yep, I despise the career criminal Hildabeast.You are a weak and insecure ass who copies other people's accounts.I agree, he is self destructing in a very public way, he can't resist the limelight this is obvious ... too bad the Office of the Presidency is where he is choosing to IMPLODE ... we all deserve much much BETTER than this GARBAGE.The level of intentional stupidity that flows from our city management team is astoundingly depressing. How do you come to a conclusion of making a TAXPAYER funded program like our parks into a lucrative revenue stream on those very taxpayers? I mean seriously you guys.... really.....?  Its time you put your crayons down and cleaned off your raspberry flavored windows and do something for the paychecks your given. Charging fees to take pictures and videos of OUR PARKS. They were and are funded by US as is your positions.  Knock it off and get over your selves already. Your just embarrassing yourself now.Yeah that explains it.  Everyone is just an idiot besides you.What a shit show.Probably another "mentally ill" person too ill to go to trial.  There used to be institutions for people like him.   Saved a ton of taxpayer money bulldozing them, didn't you now?  The best intervention is rendering the person incapable of resistance.  Those three men learned you don't talk down racists and bigots.   Sorry for their families and friends.Fuck this dude my dog is pit lab an he is the most sweetest loveable dog ever . I'd like you to do so thing to me or my dog . Plzz do . An I'll say this I have been attacked by more small dogs then big dogs in this town . So if another ankle bitter tryes getting at me ima kick that little fucker so farRick:  I just posted numerous questions about YOU and YOUR sister, and YOU Flagged them.  So, YOU are a LIAR about the open book.So, is it misogyny when Hillary Clinton called her husband's rape victims sluts, tramps and whores? Or when she threatened them to keep silent? Or when she accused a 12 year old rape victim of being a nymphomaniac and seeking out her rapist? Or just when Donald Trump says some nasty things about some nasty people?It's so weird to have an actual stupid narcissistic childish person in the white house. GW Bush wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, but at least he was moral and had a conscience. This guy is certified. I haven't seen anything like this in my lifetime. What were the people who voted for him thinking?If someone is dumb enough to smoke pot for fun, let them. It is their funeral.
This shows your ignorance and stupidity.Also your real feelings about a plant that is the safest therapeutic plant in history.Seems Newfoundland is getting a taste of what it's like for those in Ontario who had their hydro cut because they couldn't afford the escalating costs.

NFLD might as well get prepared as this is the Canada the Liberals want thinking carbon taxes and extremely expensive green energy are a solution that idiots voted them in for.Weewili the pedo's sense of reality differs greatly from the vast majority of others. 

Some say that might be a sign of great intellect....most others agree it's early onset dementia or simple stupidity.Trade Lynch, give him away, just get him off the team. Please, keep Solter, he makes Lynch look like the bust he is. Elway was talking crazy in his on air interview, to still hold on to the idea that Lynch can be a starter in the NFL is just plain, stupid, insane, idiotic
well you get my drift.Nice propaganda piece, the protestors were aggressive, but we nicely shot at them and tried to freeze them do death.This idiot is committing TREASON.  Funny how THAT manages to escape your attention.  I can poll 1,000 NON Asian-Canadians in WESTERN Canada and get a completely OPPOSITE result.  We do NOT want China having control of our technological companies OR our/US defense technology.  They must be THRILLED you buttwipes in central Canada voted Liberal, because the Conservatives have been turning them down for over a decade!!!He wants to go help terrorists then just ship him to Syria and be done with him.Drummed out of his profession and his past good work essentially erased for one stupid mistake. Repeat this enough and eventually we are left with no one pure and perfect enough to lead. 
The "politically correct" stand ready to dump people, works and words into simplistic trashbins labelled "racist", "sexist", etc. This approach only rejects and never includes. It can only destroy, never build. 
A more mature approach is required. Nations, people, and works are complex and contain contradictions. We must examine and discuss them honestly, accepting that there will always be differences of opinion. People must be allowed to evolve their views and make amends for their errors. Only then can we claim to be tolerant and progressive.I would like to know how the Idioters(sic) at the Post propose to put every student in a "high performing school" when so many are low performing? The problem is the students, not the schools. And the main problem with the students is their family background. Again, the problem is not the schools. Or the teachers. Other than the stupidity of those catering to those unwilling or unable to learn.I didn't hear Trump say "black sobs" or "African American sobs" I just heard him say sobs. Last I looked white players were kneeling as well. 

Trump is a goof for wading into this debate but he hasn't said anything that is racist.Yep you are a sore loserIf this is how Emmanuel Sanders thinks he should be allowed to drive then he should not have a license. He needs to come back down to earth and realize that he is no more special than the rest of us. My youngest is about to get his license - thank goodness I taught him to drive and not an idiot like Sanders.Last year of rae, 10.1 billion deficit, ending 1995
1st 4 years under harris, 8.8, 6.9, 3.9, 2,  1995 to 99.
Then 4 years of surplus balanced books, .7 Surplus, 1.9 Surplus, ,375 surplus, .12 surplus
Facts libtart facts so tell us lib, should harris of slashed say 100,000 public servants on day 1, or raised taxes about 50% on day one to guarantee no new debt or was it better to work the debt down for 4 years as he did until running balanced books? ANSWER COWARD!What a childish little jerk.  I hope he makes lots of friends in prison.  Maybe they can take something from him.Saw him on the news. What an arrogant arse!I missed the part where I'm supposed to give a fuckSame old shit. Yawn. I will pay attention when these guys and gals start talking economics rather than politics,Hawker and Chenault....Why do we continue to let these Corrupt Bastards hang around ?It's obvious  that the man hates pussy, lol, I guess everyone has the right to not like something, but when you go into someone else's Place, and grab there pussy they love so much and then grab there pussy right in front of them!!, and then beat it up real bad, he must be a real bad man!!!!!!Because 13 plants are DANGEROUS.  SMDH.

Grow the hell up you damn cowardly children.CrapNot too long before you go back in. Just like the Chump you are an idiot and beyond any type of help. Too much hate and prejudice just another moron.Not just uneducated, wilfully ignorant, which equates to stupid in my book.
Frankly, I don't care what happens to them. Hopefully survival of the fittest will kick in at some point and relieve the planet of the burden of these morons. I can't wait.Trump is an idiot.Women are just plain evil.Trump sycophants and imbeciles will wave this away as well.

Trump was right about not losing votes if he murdered someone.  What a disgrace.Typical Liberal spin and double-talk.  Jr. gets twice as many selfie and photo ops if they announce the spending of the same money twice, doesn't he?

When will the public wake up and recognise Trudeau for the lightweight incompetent he is?As 2 kilos go by unnoticed because a celebrity had a vial with residue in it. Lol idiots.Try reading the remark. He didn't say the president has steel balls, he was referring to himself.this is how we wasted our tax money, because this dumb lady gave water to other's property.2 years, 3 months, 24 days... till the next Canadian Federal Election..

Yeah, kicked too.no more chinese - they dont assimilate, they cheat. not fair to the other good kids who dont cheating as an option."By the way, one of the primary functions of government is to regulate business."

Is it? To what point? That business ownership becomes only a formality on paper, with backdoor socialism and in reality businesses are run by incompetent government bureaucrats dictating every aspect of it?No fool like an old fool.  He lied his way into office promising the repeal and replacement of the ACA.  McCain graduated last in his class and only because his old man was a General.  He had no business flying a navy jet and even less being a Republican Senator from the state of Arizona, home of Barry Goldwater.  He obstructed George Bushes tax cuts making them temporary, wrote unconstitutional campaign finance laws and now cements failed socialist insurance subsidies and law into our economy.  We are just lucky he lost to Obama otherwise the borders would be wide open and McCaineCare would be an even worse bipartisan law.  He is a despicable politician who was able to turn his military heroism into a decades long money tree.Trump -----> Making a game show out of Washington

What a complete idiot.Trump voters are too ignorant to follow the money. They think poor black and brown people have the money. Trump loves "poorly educated" white folks. He can count on them voting against their interests as long as they think minorities will suffer more.Give it up all ready...the dung heap belongs solely at the feet of the Democrats. Democrats alone own it and no one else. Republicans tried for years to rein in spending and the D-PIGS kept coming to the trough to feed their greed. Anyone who believes otherwise is an idiot.Excellent move Medicaid, like welfare and the PFD promotes laziness, irresponsibility. And an entitlement mentality among the laziest, non contributing slackers among us and needs to end.
I dont need to be paying for some gang banging hoodrats from Mountainview ....
Let em' rot.Forget the racist crap, unlawful immigration knows no race. Any race here unlawfully needs to have deportation proceedings initiated per Title 8 of the U.S. Code section 1225(b)(2)(A)
It reads:
"“if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding under section 1229a of this title"

It doesn't say anything about race. And implying only a "certain" race is here unlawfully is racist in itself.Any idiot involved in these programs knows that this is what happens after one year. And they wind up on the general welfare rolls. Or in political garbage speak, "Ontario Works" aka welfare."...your lowly selves!!! You're all a bunch of fools and stupid..."

Sure. Yup. Fair.You're kind of a dick, aren't you?I know what the solution is.  Why don't we just kill all the men?Trump immigration ban ushers in an age of academic darkness

When Trump went on "The View" in 2011, he said that he had hired investigators to look into Obama's birthplace. He said that "You won't believe what they're finding" and that he would be releasing their report "soon." We didn't know then what we know now: that when Trump promises to  release "proof" for any of his lies, he's lying -- in fact, it's Trump-speak for "I'm lying through my teeth." There was no report, no investigation, no investigators -- there was always and only Trump's filthy, racist lies.

What a dum bass jock!What a bunch of sick liars that you are!!Sharing mailing lists is not part of conservative principals and not an ideology in which I share.

As in other parties, there are a lot of young staffers who think that they are clever, but are actually  social morons.And where did you get your climatology degree?

Clearly you haven't read any studies on climate change (World temperatures have NOT been stable for the last 20 years, but have gone up 0.5C).

Stay in your Trumpian bubble, but please stop subjecting the rest of us to your ignorance.Beyak misses the point entirely. The PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOLS was to DESTROY aboriginal language and culture.  The children were TAKEN from their parents for no other reason.  Picture the government coming to your house and just taking your kids for no reason other than to stop you teaching them  language and customs.  YOUR HEAD WOULD EXPLODE.   BEYAK NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE SENATE. She's much much too stupid to be on the public payroll.Good answer. !!  Thank you for illustrating the utter stupidity of liberals.That guy and his dog will not live much longer walking on the road like that.  Log trucks , hot rod kids in their $500.00 dollar car with the $1500.00 muffler speeding along,  make quick work of them, there would not be enough left to cremate.

Read the Sign:  Stupidwhat planet of lib stupid do you come from? what open anything, we had no say etc, justin decided period and they are all left wingers to boot...Which sewer do you live in, Stewart?Trump dunce cap
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHhprrTWAAMEx5U.jpg:smallYou sir, are an idiot.Hillary Clinton strategist Bob Beckel appeared on on Fox calling for the assassination of Julian Assange — a blatant urge for violence against the Wikileaks founder in direct contradiction of every possible natural and government law.

Wikileaks, of course, has published several damning caches of documents showing Clinton in none-too-favorable light — including emails from her controversially-employed private server as well as communications from the DNC which proved her campaign colluded with mainstream media.

“I mean, a dead man can’t leak stuff,” Beckel chillingly noted of Assange. “The guy’s a traitor, a treasonist, and … and he has broken every law in the United States. The guy ought to be — and I’m not for the death penalty — so, if I’m not for the death penalty, there’s only one way to do it, illegally shoot the son of a bitch.”Oh how soon do we forget that Obama called ISIS Al-Queda's "JV" team. Obama is not superior but an idiotic MORON!Energy East is by far the most logical and profitable solution. But the political f-ups in quebec will kill this approach, even though they are the Canadian parasites.First, what is IMHO? Second, i dont recall him saying he watched TV earning ur comment. Third, if u r saying that we watch to much stupid stuff, and i consider a lot of tv to be stupid, rather than reading and having informative conversations with others to learn about the world around us then id have to say that i do agree with u on ur point. I hope i said that correctly. If i didnt, ur a smart man..
U can figure out what im saying. Also, i toom my glasses off so im not sure that it all the tect looks correct. Boy i need to clean out my cat box!Where did they allegedly invest $30,000,000?? That's a crock of crapOrganized idiocy!Seriously?  People in a certain area of town are too stupid to go to Craigslist to look for a job?  Why are there jobs available and also high unemployment?  There cannot be that many people with a record looking for work.  Could it be that they don't have to work because of all the handouts (welfare) from folks who are working?It just never ends..every day a new story.Will we ever be able to recover and help all South Africans especially the poor.What selfish Bastards!The only "embarrassment" is the "loser" Donald Trump and his supporters.Employers have "every right..."? You are ignorant of the law.Most of trump supporters in red states rely on the government in on way or another for support and there is no way they voted for trump to cut those programs.  They want more government support, not less.  
trump promises the moon and only stupid people believe him.I don't understand people who take their dogs everywhere with them.  To the store, to the mall, to everywhere.  Obviously this does not include support animals for blind, etc.

What really gets me is these idiots who are driving down the road with their dog in their lap.  That crap needs to stop.  Or maybe they need to get in a wreck and the dog becomes an airbag/human sandwich.Hey civil comments go fuck yourself you unamerican ASSHOLESStupid AND dishonest. He's ambidextrous.His state of mind is everything. A good atty will be hard to come by cause this will be one hell of a case to fight in trial. Anyone have $50,000 handy as a retainer? Billy Austin!! By Steve Earl comes to mind.. They will try to hang this guy in light of what has been happening in town.. He's an easy target. There is a reason the convicted are black, brown and poor.. Everyone with a brain knows that truth.Tiger doesn't change his strips, plus, his followers all point to his multiple bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits as some great 'business record' to be proud of ... 

Stupid is as stupid does, Gump was right.

Republicans need to be shot into the sun.No, I graduated with a dual masters in history and political science many years ago. I know poppycock when I see it!! And you are all bull poo. Today's democrats and their voters are socialist. Read history and political platforms. Nazis are socialist. So are communist, the Nazis were right of communism. Therefore the liberals of America took advantage of the term right wing of the right socialist in Germany. If you disagree your either intellectually dishonest or stupid. Pick your poison.It's too bad Walker won't curb his spending of billions on the "study" of the  so called natural gas pipeline.  When he was campaigning ...........seems like all he could do was complain about the useless studies that the state spent money on.    Seems as though he's outspending all of those studies on HIS useless study.Why do you suppose that Putin is helping the Syrians, is it because he likes Syrians? If he likes Syrians why didn't Russia take any refugees? So why has he helped kill so many, so what will stop him from killing more, nothing so far. So why do we have troops over there and in the middle east even, just to make men out of boys. Maybe we should just build a bunch if golf courses over there and frustrate the hell out of the Syrians. There are no answers to the nonsense.Freakin maggots, I swear.Look up ANILCA and ANCSA. God, you're ignorant.You're equating slaves with pigs?
Ridiculous.If he had said he wanted to destroy Israel and kill Jews to create a Palestinian state he would still have a job....the same way of trying to get the Republicans' Corrupt Bastards Club out of our capital.I sure don't see the MSM flailing around in the weeds. They are just reporting the news. 
OK, so you want everyone to turn away from the MSM and have everyone tune in Fox and Friends, and whatever other deplorable crap Donald wants us to think is real news.If you read the LOCATION of the weapon seizures, these were taken from the idiot left.  The Right, being primarily non-felons, likely had legal firearms.If morons like Tipton would do their jobs, especially representing his own district, there would have been a pathway to citizenship put in place that is expedient and affordable years ago. Now kids who have known nothing but the US are at risk of being deported to other countries from which they have no ties?  Typical elitist attitude finding means to their ways!Stupid IdeaAnd Notley made sure her Public Sector and other union members got their money while cut backs were hitting all other non-union Albertans....just like Trudeau and Horgan/Weaver in BC.   Typical left wing crooks.Is there no end to human stupidity???Pretty stupid comment. Israel recieves billions in aid from the US as well as unconditional support. Of course the Palestinians are not going to leave; that would give the interlopers what they want. If a foreign power moved into your neighbourhood and took it over would you just smile and accept it? Thats what you're asking the Palestinians to do. No wonder there is continued violence.ISIS like to rape women, send him to ISIS.Yes, by all means useful EU idiots; let us save the whales, save the snails, save the trees, save the seas, save the worms, and save the germs. Of course, we must carbon tax all those greedy American polluting capitalists into bankruptcy under one world government by the United Nations to save the planet from GORE- BULL warming for the greater glory of the goddess Gaia.1diot !!!Fuck this guy flag his postThis is why I would never buy anything from a big company grower....they only care about profit. I know quite a few people who use cannabis for medical reasons and they all grow their own so they know what's in it and how it was grown. Greedy assholesJonah,
…just shut up before any more people figure out how idiotic you are.The pathetic editorialists at the G&M must be foaming at the mouth in anger at this sudden turn of events. After their craven support of Housing Bubble Christy at the expense of housing affordability in BC (and by extension, Canada), the G&M has essentially declared itself an enemy of the Canadian middle class. Let's hope the housing bubble will pop now that Crooked Christy will be cast off to ignominious exile in the hinterlands of Canadian politics.

You lost, G&M Thompson stooges! And yes, that's millions of us mocking you yet again (see previous G&M editorial supporting "Cons sans Harper" in fall 2015). #fail #legacymediaisdyingHey, you are truly a moron and a Dotard.  How about all the treaties we signed with Native American Tribes.  Pretty sure the USofA did pretty well with those, while the tribes not so well.  Best you start reading books before you ask really really really stupid questions.  But then again you're a troll who know nothing about the US.The evil witch just barely had enough people fooled into thinking she was the right choice, but then the big dumb FBI director tried to help her across the finish line and fvcked it all up.. RIGHT...?Sarah Palin is an narcissistic idiot who quit her job halfway through her first term as governor of Alaska, right after coming home from torpedoing John McCain's chances at the presidency. The only reason she knows what different kinds of poop looks like, is because she bathes in it.clash of the cretinsI'm not a detective, but I've watched enough crime procedurals to recognize the signs of a really stupid criminal trying in vain to cover his tracks. And in this episode of "Law & Order: SVUSA" it's none other than Donald Trump, desperately trying to change the conversation of his collusion and dependence on Russia...by using classic KGB tactics of "deny, deflect and blame others."

Nah, that's not suspicious at all, Comrade Trump.

AM Joy guest host Jonathan Capehart hosted a national security panel with former intelligence agents, Naveed Jamali and Malcolm Nance, former State Department spokesperson Nayyera Haq, Chief Washington reporter for Mother Jones David Corn, and Tara Maller, Sr. Policy Adviser for New America, none of whom could quite believe how bumbling and blatant Trump's machinations have been.Mayor El Porko is a sick, repulsive, person.  She is a disgrace to Latinos, not only in Puerto Rico, but around the world. Disgusting-o ...look at losers like dante here, clearly a lib shill who falls for it! sad that nut jobs like him are so patheticThe voters in this country have SPOKEN very DECISIVELY, Bye, Bye, Good riddance   Hillary & Billy,  Do not let the door hit you in the Arse on your way out.The climate change has nothing to do with human kind even though humans do their best to wreak havoc on the environment - so don't flatter yourself - climate change is a result of power stronger than any influence courtesy of us idiot humansPathetic - same script repeated verbatim 4 separate times, showing a complete lack of respect for those at QP. We've got an idiot at the helm.Heaven help us if we cannot even create hydroelectric power with these clowns.
When they move into to their off-grid trailers with outside sustainable toilets, then I'll start take these hypocrites seriously.THIS FUKR IS A CONFIRMED TERRORIST AND A MUSLIM ISIS SUPPORTING IMMIGRANT
HE S NOT CANADIAN!One good reason to vote for Trump. Hillary is a narcissistic sociopathic liar and those types of liberals are very dangerous.There are over 600 First Nations across Canada. Your racist, gross stereotyping includes of all 600+ communities is just that: ignorant, gross, racist trash.Yes, the board is giving its members guidance because they're too dumb to figure out how to vote on their own. Is that the implication, Kitka?as if all social parasites have dogs....as if dogs are the problem, and not social parasites leeching off our community.

 the solution to downtown Eugene's obnoxious dysfunctional problem is simple; turn the entire area into  "homeless" camp.

 I'm going to start a ballot initiative that would mandate by law the city council must dress as clowns when meeting.I'm sick and fed up with these idiot thrill seekers endangering rescuers lives. I wish NPS Rangers would post notices saying " you fall, you get yourself out".What gets me is they make it like Trump is stupid and crazy for saying that about wiretapping and talk like it was NOT true and all the crap that was splashed all over the MSM about this and now it's true! That's why we have al this Fake News talk. Report what's fact before everyone goes spouting off their mouths.@Joe a "cool" ignorant
This is not Canada ...with a bunch of « Loyalists » Orangemen.  
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada.
After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Québec.
Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were "Orangemen" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.…
	
And Paf ! Problems started across French Canada ever since !
"EVER SINCE", got it Joe and you've showed it by your comment !LOL...not at all.  I just find it funny anyone thinks Trump is some guy of integrity.  I don't need his tax return to tell me any different; the guy's a scum.Las Vegas mass shooting: "This is the price of freedom..."  "Gun control is more of what doesn't work"
New York truck attack: BAN MUSLIMS!!!!
This country has dementia.....Obooba is a domestic terrorist. Nothing he does shocks me anymore. The more he can do to destroy america and israel the better he feels.FTP system Harper worked so hard to rig?

What a ridiculous and likely libelous statement.wrong thinking there bro. would be better if they were shooting other gang bangers.Who knew Peter Wall was such an imbecile?no, merely stupidNothing wrong with hillary, with Mr. Trump beating her ass she is just looking for the sympathy vote.What about the idiot haters?The truth hurts so you have to reply with your idiotic comments. You really do not realize how ignorant you areA high schooler should be picking up trash along the freeway. When I meet precocious, arrogant high school know-it-alls I like to say to them "When I was your age I was also an irritating asshole."No, that's your job. You right wing nut jobs positively revel in your ignorance, as does your incompetent, exceptionally ignorant pick to run the country into the ground.  You're the ones that should be deported.  Out with the stupid.  That will come soon enough. This level of stupid can't be sustained for long.This is an idiotic idea. CD Howe would be appalled.  The government is broke because it has failed to cut old idiotic spending, added new idiotic spending, overpays a bloated staff, and subsidizes silly "innovation," retirees, and politically important companies.  They need to borrow more, but PRETEND they are not borrowing (as much).  So, take existing assets that generate revenue, or COULD generate revenue (e.g. currently non-toll bridges, roads, etc.) and sell them to the private sector.  Junior gets more money to burn NOW, while the corresponding loss to the public is in the FUTURE (either public revenue now going to the new private owner, or fees/tolls to be paid on something that would have been toll-free, because it was paid for {e.g.Coquhalla in BC}).  
IF a potential project will generate enough revenue to be profitable, let the private guys build it!!  You don't need to sell existing to get money to build new - let them do it.  If returns suck, it will not be built.  So what?You sound like the Idiot.Publicity whore.What is it about Alaska that attracts jerks like this?if the shit hit the fan and trash, and electricity and water treatment plants shut down, and city was in trouble vs small town, rural peeps, who do you think would survive with the least damage and chaos and still be able to eatprosecute the bastards.Todd, are you sure you teach economics or just MatSu politics?
Your take on SB 91 is based upon a remarkable ignorance of facts.useless comment.wow you are a total nut job of lies and stupidity, clearly a hack for NK trolling or just some ignorant idiotWhat the heck is &amp???Weewili.... you are a pathetic  T - W # A * Tyou are a nut job period, trump didnt steal anything, the russians didnt do squat loser, hillary, obama, the dmc and media who were caught doing the corruption during the election did it for trump!,, get a life loser, you left wingers of hate and stupidity need helpInstead it just makes them look like the hypocrites they are"To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war." 

- Winston Churchill

President Trump is going to find out how few allies that he actually has if he provokes this situation too far.

Don't be stupid, maroon.Only a fool would not be against this president. He is massively and obviously unfit for office.You might feel differently if a drunk driver killed or maimed a member of your family.As a US citizen, I can tell you, the trumps are no farce. It's a real tragedy for us and the world. I hope I live long enough to see them all die. They are a disgrace to civilized people.You really are a rancid individual and a racist. Grow up Luv-muscle man!More like which one will be in jail first.  With Netanyahu being investigated for fraud and Trump....well who know what that clown is going to get nailed with.  Perhaps they can share a cell.You are an idiotExactly which part of my post is inaccurate?

Or do you just rely upon ad-hominem bile to express your profound ignorance, troll.I am no defender of these moronic prepper enclaves that are populating certain regions of the west. But... Randy Weaver is alive and well. His spouse and fourteen year old son were killed at Ruby Ridge and Weaver and his three surviving daughters were later awarded several million dollars for the wrongful death of their mother and brother.my god your losers are ignorant,, you can have 40% growth but when its from a very low level its still low!, see loser in GDP per capica the usa is still far ahead of canada,, thanks to pathetic left wing governments holding us backParesse K. Lai doesn't belong on this island.  Such trash!A bigoted and ignorant lie.
There's no difference between you and Joseph Goebbles.How many times have you seen the following:  One transport pulling out to pass another and taking the next 10 minutes and miles of highway to finally get past.   All this and 1/2 hour later the truck which passed is 15 - 30 seconds ahead of the slower truck.    It's just not worth it.

Trucks should be in a restricted lane, and passing should be prohibited, except in designated areas.

Concurrent with this should be driver education about lane discipline and yielding (instead of blocking) when a car comes up from behind.    It is not up to drivers to enforce the speed limit.    So if a car is tailgating - just move over and let him/her pass.    Don't be a stubborn jerk and block traffic, which should be ticketable offence.     That will help traffic flow, and if the tailgater is really speeding (or weaving in and out) leave it up to the police to catch them.how about the authorities make it abundantly clear that NO ONE will get rescued?
After a couple of people die with no one helping them, the rest of the idiots will get the message.How true, he hasn't done anything but bankrupt companies, not pay workers, not pay federal taxes, lies all the time, is a bigot& racist, insults everyone, and yea is a sexual abuser & assaults women. Worst of all he is a whiner & loser. 'For the future collapse of America & the World, Vote Trump'.HA HA HA most people knew he was the village idiot now he has proven he is the country's idiot he should be removedRight on target Brett, but this has been business as usual in Hawaii for generations.  It amazes me that these folks are like cats in a sandbox, covering up their nasties  and they have absolutely no shame about it and come right back asking the Hawaii voter to support them or the bozo that appointed them.  Worst of all, the "informed citizenry"  has little interest in demanding disclosure.  We just go to the polls and elect the same crooks year after year.Please continue your "inane" posts, Kurgan. I think it's very funny that you 'send up' the pitchfork wielding horde on here. Especially when your posts are at times so ridiculous that some people think you actually ARE a religious stuck up sticky beak. 

Folks, Kurg is only joking. It's the others who are deadly serious 😊Have these clowns in Canadian government ever had a original thought since the first tax increase.  That is all every single one of them knows, tax and spend.  To think these same people hate Trump.  Voters are such fools.Some people like Merkel are very slow learners and have trouble with logical thinking.  The sad thing is that innocent Germans, and Europeans in general, will pay for her foolish decisions.your an idiotYou can stick your dick up anyone's butt. Why have any laws at all?Holy hannigan are you fools still out there? It was called stimulus and was voted on by all three parties with the Liberals have NDP wanting more. Grow up.The most inane idiotic drivel that ever hit the comment section. Absolute conspiracy theorist out of touch with reality drivel. Monopsony? The textbook definition of babbling drivel and hogwash.Didn't see blazo's comment until after. Yeah and the same could be said to bring pot into the argument. Imagine the difference you'd see at international soccer games if marijuana was served instead of beer. I'm wagering you wouldn't see soccer riots. Ok, heroin. Or oxycontin. Have you heard of people being stabbed shot robbed burgled etc for money to buy these drugs? All the time? Marijuana. How often does someone get robbed for pot money? Only in extremely rare circumstances where the idiot was already very mentally ill.I think the homeless bums are the first suspects. they live right behind the can and bottle recycling container. Easy for them to walk over and cause pilikia. Hide at night and watch who approaches the canoes. Catch them and beat em with bats, rocks, brass knuckles, and break their legs. Attack the camps and burn down the place.What the hell is wrong with people! Sick fucks! These are children not animals!No, I just really enjoy poking stupid lefties with pointy sticks; love it when they scream in pain.   See my post about the Eloi and the Morlocks; an Eloi screaming in the night is a wonderful sound.Suck it Princess, oil is our blood line and parasites like your self are quickly becoming an endangered species!!!!

Yes the global Marxist movement is over, Britain, USA, Russia, Australia - soon France, Netherland, Germany and Italy. 

We see you and we Reject YOU!!!!!!

Fyi, Kathleen will need your help in 14 months.

Pssst Justin, Trump isn't a Globalist - now what little potato????Omg you get more stupid every day. Did you actually understand the comment? People like you handed the office to the trumpster. Now... go back to pounding your keyboard.Be careful what you wish for, Garrison. You are a fool.Is that on a flash card, cause obviously your to stupid to think of it yourself. Your about as much of a conservative as Trump. Hell I was a conservative before you could spell it. Still am, not one of those fakes like you who just came out from under the house when Donald Trump and his racist crap made you think it was safe.Piece of shit post from a piece of shit poster.too many stupid humans on the planet time to cull the herd.mo conservatives are educated into understanding freedom, economics etc thus becoming such, left wingers are brain washed stupid to what they areDepends Donny is a one-trick pony
and his trick is acting like a total swineWhat a surprise. You get two groups of idiots together and there is violence!Yeah, sorry, but you're regurgitating bullshit. You want to be a pawn for the rich, fine, but why add to the misinformation?mccain sucks!and yet another racist post proving the left are nothing but hating pieces of trashThey should never let this piece of shit out!! I'm so sick & tired of these scumbag child molesters in 
the news... & worse... on our streets!!testing purposes: 

you are an idiot and i can't stand ignorant donutholes.Jerry_D>  Can she possibly be classified as a "moron" also????I'm a CA/CPA too. 
Trudeaus statement is ludicrous.
The guy is a liar.He's a complete a total hypocrite.  He writes an article about Trump making a claim with no proof that was parroted by "fake news" sites.  When it's brought to his attention that the mainstream media does the exact same thing and did it throughout the entire election, he just shrugs his shoulders and says "meh."  There is a difference, but not one he can define and quantify.  He cites the SPJ code of ethics but then we demonstrate the establishment media doesn't even meet that criteria and he of course has no response.
Real journalists, like Green Greenwald, have tirelessly exposed this media narrative time and again.  If only we had real journalists at Civil Beat.  Pierre should get rid of it and just make an Intercept Hawaii bureau with real journalist.

"Those who most loudly denounce Fake News are typically those most aggressively disseminating it."

https://theintercept.com/2016/12/09/a-clinton-fan-manufactured-fake-news-that-msnbc-personalities-spread-to-discredit-wikileaks-docs/Proof? Show me that things have changed--and not opinion from the loony right-wing media.The farther to the left you go the dumber it gets.The countries remaining in the pact have said it's non-negotiable. Hopefully, they'll maintain that stand against the semi- ignorant, mentally deficient demagogue who thinks he has the power to negotiate anything he doesn't like. Trump has become tiresome with his lies, alternative facts and vapid comments.no surprise here, we all know that the intelligent leader of his people trump, actually understands that gW is not caused by mans carbon and has never been proven so! , how ignorant sheep like you cant see those facts is a big mystery!51.88
The number of inches of rainfall measured by a gauge in Cedar Bayou, near Mont Belvieu, Texas, according to researchers at the National Weather Service.
That’s now the greatest amount of rainfall over land for a single storm in continental U.S. history.
What kind of idiot says nothing to see here?Where was the outrage when Obama pardoned the he/she traitor that gave away the country's classified info or the 1200 plus drug dealers murders or having the parents of Bergdahl who's desertion caused the lives of American soldiers,  gotta love the hypocrites on the left.Not if they shoot you first...@Researchers - Can't you make a point without personal attacks?  Never mind, I know the answer.  Those who disagree with you are fools, and dragging kids into your narrative is perfectly fair.

I can only assume you are voting for your mentor Donald Trump come November.another ignorant alt left loser, see nut job, the usa has a very stable system in place, peaceful transitions of power etc,, and a very intelligent president regardless of the lies and hate you nut jobs thinkKissed butt.  That's ALL he's done.The mentally deranged malignant narcissist and pathological liar continues spewing bovine excrement.so a left wing liberal idiot has a problem with facts!!  SHOCKER!How interesting to read an argument that equates judicial contemplation of constitutional intent as molding "silly putty" from one who can't see the same similarity with  those who mold  Biblical intent like "silly putty".Remember that when you go to gas up your electric car, and nothing happens.

Idiot.I'm sorry. The Star-Advertiser publisher is a traditional, hard-core advertising guy. He needs to step down. That shit does not work any more. He needs to delegate to the younger people on his staff. He has no idea how to connect with his constituency any more. New blood is the order of the day. If he cannot recognize that, he is doomed.Jenny Kwan is a shrill politician with the cognitive ability of a gnat. It's these harebrained pronouncements that create serious concerns for people like myself. Why should I invest here domestically when I fear I will be burden with an ever increasing non productive population base that will creep up the existing high taxes even higher? This lady cannot even balance her own cheque book.

Gotta to face it, you can never please everyone. Canada is that country who wants to be like by everyone. It is that facebook user who is out there to collect 'friends' as trophies. And most of these friends are useless and marginal.

It just befuddles me that there is absolutely no political will to lower and remove internal trade barriers within our borders. This should be our first priority. Lowering these intraprovincial trade barriers will create jobs and wealth. These are the pragmatic issues that needs addressing not all this other useless garbage.Matthews pestered Trump as in badgered, hounded, nagged, hassled etc. him into saying something stupid. This from a guy who once said he was glad Hurricane Sandy hit the northeast because it helped Obama get elected. I don't support Trump, just think Matthews is a hypocrite and dirtbag.You can't really understand U.S. politics without acknowledging that a significant part of the American electorate consists of people who are profoundly bigoted and ignorant. Whether we call them deplorables or hicks or evangelicals, these people should be shamed and marginalized. They are a threat to decent people and to themselves.Hubris is often accompanied by stupid behavior. Examples include Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and now Mark Helfrich.On August 5, 2017,  mosque was bombed in Bloomington, MN.  Here is the complete text of President's Trump's official statement and tweet about that incident:
"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
Trump couldn't conjure up so much as a syllable -- but he sent Sebastian Gorka, one of his in-house neo-Nazis, to the August 6 Sunday talk shows to suggest that the incident may have been fake -- even as local, state and federal law enforcement were investigating it both as terrorism and as a hate crime.  Trump is a coward and a hypocrite. Deplorable. Despicable.Kennedy was the last president who was not a PINO. Surely  all heads of state know that. Trump is actually showing more spunk that all the pathetic models that came in between.This shift to support people like geert (compared correctly to trump) is a sickness overcoming the western world all because the third world masses have decided to go to reasonable countries who dislike killing them unlike their home countries. Unfortunately these people refuse to stand up to oppose the crooked self and friends rulers who don't hesitate to kill to kill them. When they arrive in refugee camps the majority don't bother to learn their target countries ways  or languages. The Dutch took in the Indonesian people because they were loyal to the Dutch. But this new batch believe the west owes them a living and that they have the right to live just like home under strange systems that made those countries what they are. 
The Turks have no right to politik Turks living in the Netherland and calling the Dutch Nazis is the pot calling the kettle black.
Lets hope the Dutch do not forget their Dutchess and dump this ignorant wannabe trump.typical anti everything stupidity, hey loser every job is a good job for growth,, now tell your stupidity to the welder who will build this line that he cant pay his mortgage etc,, thanks to your stupidityLots of commenters here seem to be making the same mistake that we all made a year ago. Do not underestimate Donald Trump. Sure, he is a thin-skinned, bullying, ignorant narcissist, but he defied every pundit to get where he is, and the worst thing we can do is to think that he is going to self-destruct. The destruction will have to come from somewhere else.My god, how dare you confuse this person with simple facts! You have some nerve. Thank God the RG gives the truly stupid people of Eugene a voice on their op-ed page.Look BJ, if you can sleep voting for the criminal enterprise know as the Clintons you're pretty pathetic.TRUMP IS A BAD DEAL FOR ALL AMERICANS
This bumbling buffoon couldn't make an educated decision if you put a gun to his head.
What an absolutely embarrassing excuse for a world "leader."
Perhaps he's just trying to enjoy the limelight a little longer before Comey strings him up.
Can't wait to see this moron rot in jail.
PATHETICProggie here. It's fox or nothing fuckwad.Trump doesn't understand most, or even any of the actual issues, and he's too lazy to be bothered. That's why he brays like a jack@$$ at his rallies and with twitter. It distracts his often as-ignorant base.That's a taxi dome light in the photo from a car in the next lane idiot.  Now go away manini!Just kick an ice pick in to  his left ear, up to the hilt.Well, criminals are often extremely stupid people. This guy probably made a habit of doing extremely stupid things that the average Joe doesn't understand.These women were mothers daughters friends and truly good people at heart. No matter what they did they deserve to be called women.the one killed was a dear friend to myself and many others so fuck off manI am surprised. Whole world knows and considers him a stupid..... Why fear him. Make an aliance against him. Move forward. He will be isolated eventually. he cannot bully his alliesThey are not "refugees" and "migrants "; they are invaders.Being a Liberal is a disease.

See I can spout nonsense just as easy as you.Yes, very bright, maybe Obama was not as ineffectual and weak like Jimmy Carter. But close.You're a sick apologist. A girl in middle school is 11 years old turning 12 in 6th grade. That is far from a sexually mature girl. Vasquez should be neutered. As should all pedophiles. And their apologists.Relax, relax....   San Andras will take care of San Franscisco's problems just as The Big One will do for Portland.   Mother Nature always kicks ass last.That's it Canada needs' to separate from Ontario we can't be in a Union with one Province that doesn't have"Freedom of Speech", how stupid, corrupt and how big of Canada haters' are these corrupted George Soros bought off sellout Ontario legislators? I want no part of a relationship with a Province like that! Definitely the West needs to separate from the East and create a Border stop there! Two separate countries! I want nothing to do with ISLAM and that is our Right! http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/anti-islamophobia-motion-passes-in-ontario-legislature/article34126687/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=Referrer%3A+Social+Network+%2F+Media&utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+LinksEd is a political whore like all the politicians. Drain the swamp!What a waste of skin

Your typical wealthy, mainstream male idiot that the USA seems to be full ofThe photo on the hard copy edition of the paper says that this is one arrogant lady.Hey 'lil Donnie, since you are no longer an effective "useful idiot" for your Master Vlad you should avoid Russian tea parties. They like to serve a good pot of polonium tea.Its weird that Trump was never called a racist bigot etc etc until after running against democrats.  btw republicans are only marginally worse than democrats.  Either you are blind or stupidHopefully he will wake up and remember what he has said in the past.  Single pay health care.  Come on Donald show some guts.  lol

Not likely to happen I know.  But one can always hope.  Shame the Donald is just a liar.Notice how The Clinton Foundation was shut down when she didn't win. Now Chelsea Clinton is being forced upon us because those people want something for their money.

The Clinton's are far more corrupt than Donald could ever be, but they say nice things so all is forgiven. Millennials and Dems are either willfully ignorant or stupid I can't decide which one it is.An asshole!Hi, ignoramus, love to see you in an alley way and
beat you with a louieville slugger. This will come 
to pas and whites will lose. Why, because they still
haven't even figured out which are men and which
are women. Terrible a race that can't even figure out
that born with a penis is male and a vagina is female.
Thank the Great one whites won't survive 50 more
years.self deportation...MANY OF US have been preaching this for YEARS....time for everyday people to run this damn country.Super cool, wow, what notalent@$$clown missed these details when 'writing' this article ... great post!!Trump licks dirty socks!
HAHAHAHAHHAHA!"...throwing him to the ground and punching him repeatedly."  Damn...and I missed it...Blow that pretentious crap out your ear, Chance.

All you've done is show everyone your own lack of character.I knew it wouldn't be long before one of you left nuts said something stupid like that....
It seems to happen daily.Stupid, unhelpful, non sequitur post. Is that supposed to bolster the un-American position that people shouldn't have access to firearms? We can't hide and wait for armed police to show up. It could take hours or in some circumstances days for law enforcement to reach you here in Alaska. Freedom comes with risk that some will exploit it. We don't ban cars because some use them to run over people. Or alcohol because some insist on driving drunk. There're over 300 million guns in this country and somehow only about 13 thousand people are murdered with them each year. 15% more people are actually killed by drunk drivers each year in the US than are murdered with all types of firearms combined. So maybe we SHOULD talk about banning alcohol. If it saves even 1 life, right?Big man, Pig man...ha ha charade you are...Idiotic. If they want to speed up the game kill the walks to the mound.what a bunch of nonsense, Obama was the one using exec orders to circumvent the law, trump is not, it is all legalTwo new contestants for America's Dumbest Criminals.'
Trump is a traitorous buffoon.

(and a con man)

And he's surrounded himself with treasonous con men.
.


And his supporters whole heartedly cheer their very own demise.

Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda (web version) — Indivisible Guide


https://www.indivisibleguide.com/webHey corporal 11 I don't think that your mentors were laughing on that baseball field or in that dugout today and neither should you. That's the trouble with some of you Chumpsters. Just like your idiot president everything  seems to be a joke even with life and death situations. Why don't you make a serious contribution to this commentary site instead of sticking to the reactions or your stupid repetition of same sentences.BLM doesn't want equal treatment.  They want to be above the law.  They want to kill white cops and they want to loot towns and get free stuff.  Doesn't sound that different.  They are both hate groups.  They can say they aren't, but their actions speak otherwise.You have to be pretty ignorant to not understand that terrorist attacks are always political, not religious,  even if the terrorists claim to be religious. 
ISIS does not represent any religion. 
Get educated.The republicans are basically idiots; just like the democrats.How dumb are they. They're trained and paid to perform for rich 1% whites. Like race horses.Trudeau must be lining up for selfies in his yoga pants as we speak....
You now this is April Fools joke right?
No idiot would go to ChequesRUS - STAN without good cause. 
The real question is why?
Look up the words "useful idiot" on google.
It becomes clearer 
Trust me.rightee oo lester clownSo is his mother. They are silver spoon parasites.She is saying "you will pay less on your Hydro bill and I will get it back in taxes or by running up the debt." She really does think people are stupid.Not a fan of Trudeau but I'll give him full marks for his "bean counter" comment with respect to the auto trade. That would be sheer lunacy trying to figure all that out and we'd be forced to levy a tax as well. Dumb.Because Christians don't strap bombs to kids and women and blow themselves up.  Look at all the mass killings and the one thing in common...Muslims.No, you are absolutely correct.  The staggering intellect you are equipped with clearly means that you know much better than myself what I said.  

Do you ever get a sense of how foolish it appears for you to be saying completely nonsensical things as a straw man tactic?
But its a good thing you do...syntax is certainly more important than raging narcissism, ignorance, etcYou are a hypocrite of the lowest order.......Tulo could EASILY whip the tar out of you.  And he doesn't even  know     NOR WILL HE EVER  KNOW      of your pathetic existence  on the meager  slice of dirt that you reside upon

........hey tough guy, this is where you tell us how much money you makeHow stupid!

What law says you can't dissolve a company during an investigation??In 1976 Parklands and Century City didn't exist. What's your point apart from being prejudiced? Population growth and migration are facts of of human development since the dawn of time but it appears bigots, who're always noting Eastern Cape 'refugees' and the expansion of black suburbs, don't understand or won't accept this fact. 
For those who don't go there, areas like Table View, Parklands, Century City, Somerset West, etc are like another city, so has it expanded within the last 15 years, never mind 30, much of it new. Are you saying residents of CT's old suburbs - before these new white (and black) ones - should resent ALL relative newcomers. (Where do YOU live btw?) Get over it!
In 2006 a city water engineer told me new developments were straining the city's water and sanitation capacity. I'm tired of ignorant comments blaming the DA's incompetence on others. I value freedom of speech but sometimes it's a pain having to hear/read the rubbish, on all sides.He is now officially an Idiot Savant.Yes, I'm biased against the willfully ignorant.  I don't need anecdotal stories  from my running group, I just have to listen to the president and owner of the birther movement that rode a wave a hate,contempt and intolerance to the WH.What Bavious stated here is so obvious that any fool can see that this is way thing are now in Canada and the USA. Apparently, ​you are a sub-fool since you are unable to see things for what they are. The proof is in how things are getting harder each year in Canada ... Debt is killing families. Wise up.Confirmed?......only in the mind of Leftists, anti-American zealots like you.Bunch of malarkey.  The universe has been around 14.5 billion and we just got here.  Very vain to think like these idiots.The democrat losers will try to sabotage his entire Presidency in this manor.girls are so ickyEasy now Kellyanne, it isn't like Weinstein was audio taped bragging about grabbing women by the pussy or anything.That whenever one tries to generalize about groups of people, one might be accused of stereotyping.  He could also be accused of stereotyping in saying that black people are wasting their money in strip clubs.

While there are complaints about the line being perceived as perpetuation of an ancient stereotype, it's also clear that Jay-Z's thesis is that to overcome oppression, black people should emulate Jews in America by accumulating inter-generational wealth.  Whether you buy the capitalism as cure thesis or not, it's clear his intent is not to put people down, but to build them up.
